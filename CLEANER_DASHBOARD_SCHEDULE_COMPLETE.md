## Features Implemented

- ⚪ Gray badges for days off
- 📊 Badge showing "X days/week" count
- 📝 Note: "Your schedule is set by your manager"

[M] [T] [W] [T] [F] [S] [S]
 ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✓   ✗   ✗
```

### 2. Session Data Enhancement

**CleanerSession Interface:**
```typescript
interface CleanerSession {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  photo_url: string | null;
  areas: string[];
  is_available: boolean;
  rating: number;
  available_monday?: boolean;
  available_tuesday?: boolean;
  available_wednesday?: boolean;
  available_thursday?: boolean;
  available_friday?: boolean;
  available_saturday?: boolean;
  available_sunday?: boolean;
}
```

### 3. Authentication Updates

Both password and OTP authentication now include day availability:

```typescript
.select('id, name, phone, photo_url, areas, is_available, rating, 
         available_monday, available_tuesday, available_wednesday, 
         available_thursday, available_friday, available_saturday, 
         available_sunday, ...')
```

### 4. Location Tracker Error Fix

**Issues Fixed:**
- Location updates attempted before session loaded
- Generic error messages
- Poor error response handling

**Solutions:**
- Added 2-second delay before first location update
- Enhanced error handling with proper response parsing
- Better error message extraction from API responses
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

## User Experience

### For Cleaners

✅ **Immediate Visibility** - Schedule shown at top of dashboard  
✅ **Visual Clarity** - Color-coded badges easy to understand  
✅ **Planning** - Know work schedule at a glance  
✅ **Transparency** - See what admin has set  
✅ **Context** - Note explains who manages schedule  

### Example Use Case

1. **Cleaner logs in** → Session includes day availability
2. **Dashboard loads** → "My Weekly Schedule" card appears
3. **Visual display** → Green/gray badges show work days
4. **Quick reference** → "5 days/week" badge shows total
5. **Understanding** → Note explains admin controls schedule

## Technical Details

### Day Availability Logic

The system uses boolean columns for each day:
- `available_monday` through `available_sunday`
- Default: `TRUE` (all days available)
- Admin can toggle specific days on/off
- Cleaners see their current schedule
- Changes reflect immediately on next login

### Data Flow

```
1. Admin Dashboard
   └── Sets cleaner weekly schedule
       └── Updates `cleaners` table

2. Cleaner Login
   └── Auth API includes day fields
       └── Session data populated

3. Dashboard Mount
   └── `CleanerSession` contains schedule
       └── `DayAvailabilityDisplay` renders

4. Visual Display
   └── Green badges for work days
   └── Gray badges for days off
```

### Integration with Booking System

The weekly schedule works in conjunction with:
- **Master Toggle** (`is_available`) - Must be ON
- **Day Schedule** - Must work on that specific day
- **Time Slots** - Specific booking times tracked
- **Auto-unavailability** - Booked slots marked unavailable

Both master toggle AND day schedule must be true for availability.

## Testing Completed

✅ Authentication includes day fields
