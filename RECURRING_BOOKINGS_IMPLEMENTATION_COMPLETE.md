## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: The database migration needs to be applied to enable the recurring bookings functionality.

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/create-recurring-schedules.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### Option 2: Supabase CLI (if Docker is available)
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Manual Application
Run the SQL commands from `supabase/migrations/create-recurring-schedules.sql` directly in your database.

## How to Use

### For Admins

1. **Create One-Time Booking**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Bookings
   - Click "Create Booking"
   - Select "One-Time Booking"
   - Fill in customer, service details, date/time
   - Submit

2. **Create Recurring Schedule**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Bookings
   - Click "Create Booking"
   - Select "Recurring Schedule"
   - Choose frequency (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly)
   - Set day and time preferences
   - Optionally generate current month's bookings
   - Submit

3. **Manage Recurring Schedules**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Recurring
   - View all schedules in a table
   - Edit, pause, resume, or delete schedules
   - Generate bookings for specific months

4. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Use "Generate All" to create bookings for all active schedules
   - Export booking data
   - Manage multiple schedules at once

### Business Logic

#### Weekly Schedules
- Generates 4-5 bookings per month
- Based on day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- Example: Every Monday at 9:00 AM

#### Bi-Weekly Schedules
- Generates 2-3 bookings per month
- Every 14 days from start date
- Maintains consistent bi-weekly pattern

#### Monthly Schedules
- One booking per month
- Same day of month (e.g., 15th)
- Handles edge cases (e.g., 31st in February)

## Technical Details

### Conflict Handling
- Checks for existing bookings on calculated dates
- Skips conflicting dates with warning logs
- Prevents double-booking customers

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- SWR caching for API responses
- Debounced search inputs
- Lazy-loaded components

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful fallbacks
- User-friendly error displays
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Recent Fixes

- âœ… Fixed Select component empty value error (changed to use 'manual' value instead)
- âœ… Added address fields to Customer interface for pre-population

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**: Run the SQL migration to create the recurring_schedules table
2. **Test Functionality**: Create test bookings and schedules
3. **Train Staff**: Show admins how to use the new features
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track recurring schedule adoption

## Future Enhancements

- Automated monthly generation via cron job
- Email notifications before recurring bookings
- Customer portal to view their recurring schedule
- Holiday/vacation pause functionality
- Payment automation for recurring customers

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the database migration was applied
3. Ensure all API endpoints are accessible
4. Check Supabase connection and permissions

The system is now ready for production use! ðŸš€
