# Request Indexing for Fixed URLs

## URLs to Request Indexing For

### Location Pages (7 URLs)
1. https://shalean.co.za/location/cape-town/george
2. https://shalean.co.za/location/cape-town/paarl
3. https://shalean.co.za/location/durban/pietermaritzburg

5. https://shalean.co.za/location/grahamstown
6. https://shalean.co.za/location/jeffreys-bay
7. https://shalean.co.za/location/port-elizabeth

### Service Redirects (Verify)
- https://shalean.co.za/services/move-in-out-cleaning (should redirect to /services/move-turnover)

### Other Fixed URLs
- https://shalean.co.za/services/deep-cleaning (verify page loads)
- https://shalean.co.za/popia (verify page loads)
- https://shalean.co.za/cookies (verify page loads)

## Steps to Request Indexing

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select property: shalean.co.za
3. Use URL Inspection tool (search bar at top)
4. For each URL:
   - Paste URL
   - Click "Test Live URL"
   - Wait for "URL is on Google" or "URL is not on Google"
   - Click "Request Indexing"
   - Wait for confirmation

## Alternative: Sitemap Resubmission

1. Go to Sitemaps section
2. Find your sitemap (usually: https://shalean.co.za/sitemap.xml)
3. Click "Resubmit" or remove and re-add
4. This will trigger crawl of all URLs in sitemap

## Notes

- Google limits indexing requests (about 10 per day per property)
- Priority URLs should be requested individually
- Sitemap resubmission is better for bulk URLs
- It may take a few days for Google to crawl and index
