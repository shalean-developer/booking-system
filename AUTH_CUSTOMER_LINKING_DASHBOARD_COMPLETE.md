# Auth-Customer Linking & Dashboard - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully fixed the customer-auth linking system and created a user dashboard. Users are now automatically linked to existing customer profiles on signup, and redirected to their dashboard after login/signup instead of the booking form.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed & Implemented

### 1. **Customer Linking on Signup** ✅
**New file: `app/api/auth/link-customer/route.ts`**

Created API endpoint that:
- Receives email and auth_user_id from signup
- Searches for existing customer profiles with matching email (where auth_user_id is NULL)
- Links customer to auth user by setting auth_user_id
- Returns success whether linking occurred or not
- Handles edge cases gracefully

**Flow:**
```
User signs up → API searches customers by email → 
If found: UPDATE auth_user_id → Linked ✅
If not found: Continue (will be created on first booking) ✅
```

### 2. **Updated Signup Page** ✅
**Modified: `app/signup/page.tsx`**

Changes:
- After successful signup, immediately calls `/api/auth/link-customer`
- Passes user email and auth_user_id to link API
- Logs results for debugging
- Non-blocking: continues even if linking fails
- Changed redirect from `/booking/service/select` to `/dashboard`
- Updated emailRedirectTo to `/dashboard`

**Before:**
```typescript
emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/booking/service/select`
router.push('/booking/service/select');
```

**After:**
```typescript
emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/dashboard`
// Link customer profile
await fetch('/api/auth/link-customer', {...});
router.push('/dashboard');
```

### 3. **Updated Login Page** ✅
**Modified: `app/login/page.tsx`**

Changes:
- Changed redirect from `/booking/service/select` to `/dashboard`
- Users now go to dashboard after login

**Before:**
```typescript
router.push('/booking/service/select');
```

**After:**
```typescript
router.push('/dashboard');
```

### 4. **User Dashboard** ✅
**New file: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`**

Comprehensive dashboard with:

**Authentication Check:**
- Checks if user is authenticated on load
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Uses Supabase auth to get current user

**Dashboard Sections:**

1. **Welcome Header**
   - Personalized greeting with user's first name
   - Sign out button

2. **Stats Cards (3 cards)**
   - Total Bookings: Shows total number of bookings
   - Upcoming: Count of future bookings
   - Completed: Count of completed bookings
   - Each with icon and color coding

3. **Recent Bookings Section**
   - Displays last 5 bookings
   - Shows service type, date, time, address, price, status
   - Status badges with color coding (completed, confirmed, pending)
   - Empty state with "Book a Service" CTA if no bookings
   - "View All" button if more than 5 bookings

4. **Profile Card (Sidebar)**
   - User avatar (icon-based)
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Member since date
   - Edit Profile button (placeholder for future)

5. **Quick Actions Card**
   - "Book a Service" button → links to booking flow
   - "Back to Home" button → links to homepage

**Features:**
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Loading state with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with friendly messages
- ✅ Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- ✅ Consistent branding
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types

### 5. **Dashboard Bookings API** ✅
**New file: `app/api/dashboard/bookings/route.ts`**

GET endpoint that:
- Requires authentication (returns 401 if not authenticated)
- Gets authenticated user using `getAuthUser()` helper
- Finds customer profile by auth_user_id
- Fetches all bookings for that customer
- Sorts by date (most recent first)
- Accepts optional `?limit` query parameter
- Returns customer data + bookings array
- Handles case where user has no customer profile yet

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "bookings": [...],
  "customer": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "totalBookings": 5
  }
}
```

- **When:** User makes a booking
- **How:** If auth user + existing profile without auth link → links it
- **Covers:** Users who sign up then book for first time

### 3. **On Customer API** (Already Existed ✅)
- **File:** `app/api/customers/route.ts` (lines 64-77, 161-180)
