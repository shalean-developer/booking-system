## 🎯 Technical Implementation

Each navigation button now:

1. **Updates State** - Increments/decrements step number
2. **Navigates Immediately** - Uses `router.push()` for instant transition
3. **Maintains Context** - Service slug preserved in URL
4. **Persists Data** - All form data saved to localStorage

Example implementation:
```typescript
const handleNext = useCallback(() => {
  if (state.service) {
    const slug = serviceTypeToSlug(state.service);
    next(); // Update step number
    router.push(`/booking/service/${slug}/schedule`); // Navigate now!
  }
}, [state.service, next, router]);
```
