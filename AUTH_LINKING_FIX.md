# Auth-Customer Profile Linking Fix

## 🔍 Problem Summary

**Issue:** Customer profiles not linking to authenticated users

**Symptoms:**
- User signs up and logs in successfully ✅
- User completes booking ✅
- But `auth_user_id` in customer profile remains NULL ❌
- No autofill during booking for logged-in users ❌
- Booking correctly linked to `customer_id` ✅

**Root Cause:** Auth detection not working properly in API routes due to cookie reading issues

---

## ✅ Immediate Fix (Manual SQL Link)

**For existing users whose profiles aren't linked:**

### Step 1: Run SQL Script

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Open file: `supabase/link-auth-to-customer.sql`
3. Run Step 3 (the UPDATE command):

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET auth_user_id = (
  SELECT id 
  FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email = 'chitekedzaf@gmail.com'
)
WHERE email ILIKE 'chitekedzaf@gmail.com'
  AND auth_user_id IS NULL;
```

4. Verify with Step 4:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.id AS customer_id,
  c.email AS customer_email,
  c.auth_user_id,
  a.email AS auth_email
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN auth.users a ON c.auth_user_id = a.id
WHERE c.email ILIKE 'chitekedzaf@gmail.com';
```

**Expected Result:** `auth_user_id` should now be populated

---

## 🔧 Code Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Auth Detection (`lib/auth.ts`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added detailed console logging
- ✅ Check all possible cookie names
- ✅ Try project-ref-prefixed cookies (`@supabase/ssr` pattern)
- ✅ Better error messages

**Before:**
```typescript
const authToken = cookieStore.get('sb-access-token')?.value 
               || cookieStore.get('supabase-auth-token')?.value;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const allCookies = cookieStore.getAll();
console.log('🔍 Auth check - Available cookies:', cookieNames);

const authToken = 
  cookieStore.get('sb-access-token')?.value ||
  cookieStore.get('supabase-auth-token')?.value ||
  cookieStore.get('sb-auth-token')?.value ||
  allCookies.find(c => c.name.includes('-auth-token'))?.value;
```

### 2. Fixed Variable Scope (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`)

**Problem:** `authUser` was defined in nested block, not available in email fallback

**Before:**
```typescript
if (authUser) {
  // Check by auth_user_id
}

if (!customerId) {
  // Check by email
  if (authUser && !existing.auth_user_id) {  // ❌ authUser out of scope
    // Link profile
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const authUser = await getAuthUser();  // ✅ Declare at top

if (authUser) {
  // Check by auth_user_id
}

if (!customerId) {
  // Check by email
  if (authUser && !existing.auth_user_id) {  // ✅ Now in scope
    // Link profile
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging (Both APIs)

**Added to both `bookings` and `customers` API routes:**
- 🔐 Log when auth user detected (with email + ID)
- ℹ️ Log when guest user (no auth)
- 🔗 Log when linking guest profile to auth
- ✅ Log when profile found by auth_user_id
- ✅ Log when profile updated

**Example:**
```typescript
if (authUser) {
  console.log('🔐 Authenticated user detected:', authUser.email, '(ID:', authUser.id + ')');
} else {
  console.log('ℹ️ No authenticated user - guest checkout');
}
```

### 4. Created Proper Server Client (`lib/supabase-server.ts`)

**New file:** Proper way to use Supabase auth in API routes

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { createClient, getServerAuthUser } from '@/lib/supabase-server';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const user = await getServerAuthUser();
  
  if (user) {
    // User is authenticated
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Uses `@supabase/ssr` createServerClient
- Properly reads cookies in Next.js App Router
- More reliable than manual cookie reading

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Test 1: Manual Link Works ✅

**Steps:**
1. Run SQL link script (above)
2. Login at: http://localhost:3002/login
3. Start new booking
4. Go to "Contact & Address" step
5. Should see: "We found your saved information" ✅
6. Click "Autofill" → Details populate ✅

**Expected:**
- Autofill works
- No manual entry needed
- Faster checkout

---

### Test 2: New Booking Auto-Links ✅

**Steps:**
1. Ensure logged in
2. Complete full booking flow
3. Check terminal/console logs:
   - Should see: "🔐 Authenticated user detected: email@example.com"
   - Should see: "✅ Customer profile found by auth_user_id"
   - Should see: "✅ Auth user profile updated"

4. Check database:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.email,
  c.auth_user_id,
  c.total_bookings,
  COUNT(b.id) AS bookings_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON b.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.email = 'your-email@example.com'
GROUP BY c.id;
```

**Expected:**
- `auth_user_id` is populated ✅
- `total_bookings` incremented ✅
- Bookings linked correctly ✅

---

### Test 3: Guest Checkout Still Works ✅

**Steps:**
1. Logout (if logged in)
2. Start new booking
3. Complete as guest
4. Check logs:
   - Should see: "ℹ️ No authenticated user - guest checkout"
   - Should see: "ℹ️ Creating new customer profile..."

5. Check database:

```sql
SELECT id, email, auth_user_id 
FROM customers 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:**
- Profile created ✅
- `auth_user_id` is NULL ✅
- Booking works perfectly ✅

---

### Test 4: Guest → Auth Link ✅

**Steps:**
1. Complete booking as guest
2. Sign up/login with SAME email
3. Complete another booking
4. Check logs:
   - Should see: "🔗 Linking guest profile to authenticated user..."
   - Should see: "✅ Guest profile successfully linked to auth user"

5. Check database:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  auth_user_id,
  total_bookings,
  created_at
FROM customers
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**Expected:**
- Only ONE customer record ✅
- `auth_user_id` now populated ✅
- `total_bookings` = 2 (guest + auth) ✅
- All booking history preserved ✅

## 🐛 Debugging Auth Issues

If auth linking still doesn't work, check logs:

### 1. Check Cookie Detection

**In terminal when booking API is called:**

```
🔍 Auth check - Available cookies: ['sb-xxxxx-auth-token', ...]
🔑 Auth token found, verifying with Supabase...
✅ Auth user found: user@example.com (uuid-here)
```

**If you see:**
```
ℹ️ No auth token found - guest user
```

**Then:** Cookies aren't being read properly

**Solutions:**
- Check browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
- Look for Supabase auth cookies
- Cookie name might be different (project-specific)
- Try logging in again

---

### 2. Check API Route Receives Auth

**Add this temporarily to `app/api/bookings/route.ts`:**

```typescript
console.log('=== REQUEST HEADERS ===');
console.log('Cookie header:', req.headers.get('cookie'));
```

**Expected:** Should see long cookie string with Supabase tokens

**If missing:** API route not receiving cookies
- Check Next.js middleware
- Check if running in production mode
- Check CORS settings

---

### 3. Test Auth Detection Directly

**Create test endpoint: `app/api/test-auth/route.ts`:**

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getAuthUser } from '@/lib/auth';
import { getServerAuthUser } from '@/lib/supabase-server';

export async function GET() {
  const method1 = await getAuthUser();
  const method2 = await getServerAuthUser();
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    method1_result: method1 ? `Found: ${method1.email}` : 'Not found',
    method2_result: method2 ? `Found: ${method2.email}` : 'Not found',
  });
}
```

**Test:** Visit http://localhost:3002/api/test-auth while logged in

**Expected:** Both methods should find the user

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Immediate (Required):**
Run manual SQL link for existing users:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE customers
SET auth_user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = customers.email)
WHERE auth_user_id IS NULL
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM auth.users WHERE email = customers.email);
```

### 2. **Test (Required):**
- Login and start booking
- Check logs for auth detection
- Verify autofill works
- Complete booking
- Check database linkage

### 3. **Monitor (Recommended):**
- Watch terminal logs during bookings
- Look for "🔐 Authenticated user detected"
- Confirm "✅ Auth user profile updated"
- Check for any "❌" errors

### 4. **Optional Improvements:**
- Use `lib/supabase-server.ts` instead of `lib/auth.ts`
- Add auth status badge in booking UI
- Show "Logged in as X" in header during booking
- Add profile management page

## 📝 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still No Auth Detection

**Symptom:** Logs show "ℹ️ No auth token found"

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cookies and login again
2. Check cookie names in browser dev tools
3. Verify Supabase URL matches in `.env`
4. Try `lib/supabase-server.ts` instead

---

### Issue 2: Autofill Not Appearing

**Symptom:** Profile linked but no autofill

**Check:**
1. Is `auth_user_id` actually populated in database?
2. Does customer email match exactly?
3. Check `step-contact.tsx` logs in browser console
4. Verify customer API returns `isAuthenticated: true`

**SQL to verify:**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.email,
  c.auth_user_id,
  a.email AS auth_email
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN auth.users a ON c.auth_user_id = a.id
WHERE c.email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

---

### Issue 3: Multiple Customer Records

**Symptom:** Two profiles for same email

**This can happen if:**
- Booked as guest AFTER signing up
- Auth linking failed
- Email case mismatch

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Find duplicates
SELECT email, COUNT(*) 
FROM customers 
GROUP BY LOWER(email) 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Merge manually (keep the one with auth_user_id)
-- Update bookings to point to correct customer
UPDATE bookings
SET customer_id = 'correct-uuid'
WHERE customer_id = 'duplicate-uuid';

-- Delete duplicate
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 'duplicate-uuid';
```
