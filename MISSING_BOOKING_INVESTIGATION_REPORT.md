# Missing Booking Investigation & Fix - Complete Report

## üö® Critical Issue Summary

**Booking ID:** `BK-1761196261961-hdv0frqw9`  
**Status:** Customer has booking ID but booking is not visible in admin dashboard  
**Impact:** No confirmation emails sent to customer or admin  
**Severity:** HIGH - Customer paid but service not scheduled  

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Email Failure ‚Üí Booking Rollback

The booking system has a **rollback mechanism** that deletes bookings from the database if email sending fails:

1. ‚úÖ **Payment succeeds** ‚Üí Customer gets booking ID
2. ‚úÖ **Booking created** ‚Üí Saved to database  
3. ‚ùå **Email sending fails** ‚Üí Network/API issues
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rollback attempted** ‚Üí Booking deleted from database
5. ‚ùå **Rollback fails** ‚Üí Booking remains but hidden/inconsistent state

### Code Location
**File:** `app/api/bookings/route.ts` (lines 376-395)
```typescript
// ROLLBACK: Delete the booking from database since emails failed
if (dbSaved) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Rolling back: Deleting booking from database...');
  try {
    const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
      .from('bookings')
      .delete()
      .eq('id', bookingId);
    
    if (deleteError) {
      console.error('‚ùå Failed to rollback booking:', deleteError);
      console.error('CRITICAL: Booking exists but emails not sent. Manual intervention required.');
    }
  } catch (rollbackErr) {
    console.error('‚ùå Rollback failed:', rollbackErr);
    console.error('CRITICAL: Booking may exist without emails. Manual intervention required.');
  }
}
```

  END as status;
```

### Step 3: Recover Booking (if exists)
```sql
-- If booking exists but has wrong status
UPDATE bookings 
SET 
  status = 'confirmed',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'BK-1761196261961-hdv0frqw9'
  AND status IN ('pending', 'draft', 'failed');
```

### Step 4: Manual Email Sending
- Use admin dashboard to manually send confirmation emails
- Or contact customer directly with booking details
