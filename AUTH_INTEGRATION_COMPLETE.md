# Supabase Auth Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully integrated Supabase Auth with the customer profile system. Authenticated users automatically get their profiles linked to their auth accounts, while guest checkout remains fully functional. This is a **hybrid system** - auth is optional, enhancing the experience for logged-in users without blocking guests.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ What Was Built

**1. Database Schema** (`supabase/add-auth-to-customers.sql`)
- Added `auth_user_id` column to `customers` table
- Foreign key reference to `auth.users(id)`
- Unique constraint: one profile per auth user
- Nullable for guest checkout support
- Index for fast auth user lookups

**2. Auth Helper Functions** (`lib/auth.ts`)
- `getAuthUser()` - Detects authenticated users from cookies
- `isAuthenticated()` - Boolean check for auth status  
- `getAuthUserEmail()` - Gets email if authenticated
- Works in API routes without additional dependencies
- Gracefully handles missing auth (returns null for guests)

**3. Enhanced Customer API** (`app/api/customers/route.ts`)
- **GET:** Checks auth_user_id first, then falls back to email
- **GET:** Auto-links guest profiles to auth users when detected
- **POST:** Creates profiles with auth_user_id when authenticated
- **POST:** Links existing guest profiles to new auth users
- All operations work for both auth and guest users

**4. Enhanced Bookings API** (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- Checks for authenticated user at booking time
- Queries customer profile by auth_user_id first
- Falls back to email query for guests
- Auto-links guest profiles to auth users
- Creates profiles with auth link when authenticated
- Maintains guest checkout if no auth detected

**5. Updated Types** (`types/booking.ts`)
- Added `customer_id` to BookingState
- Added `Customer` interface
- Added `CustomerCheckResponse` interface

## How It Works

### Authentication Detection

```typescript
// In API routes
const authUser = await getAuthUser();

if (authUser) {
  // User is authenticated
  // Query by auth_user_id
  // Link profile to auth account
} else {
  // User is guest
  // Query by email only
  // No auth linking
}
```

### Profile Linking Strategy

**Priority Order:**
1. Check `auth_user_id` (if user authenticated)
2. Check `email` (for guests or new auth users)
3. Create new profile with appropriate linking

**Auto-Linking:**
- Guest books → Profile created (auth_user_id = NULL)
- Same user logs in → Books again → Profile found by email
- System automatically sets auth_user_id on existing profile
- Future bookings use auth_user_id (faster, more secure)

## User Flows

### Guest User (No Auth) - Works Exactly As Before

1. User visits booking page (not logged in)
2. Completes service selection, details, schedule
3. **Step 4:** Enters email → Profile check by email only
4. If email exists: Autofill prompt appears
5. If new email: No prompt
6. Submit → Profile created/updated (auth_user_id = NULL)
7. Booking saved and linked to guest profile

**Result:**
- ✅ Guest checkout fully functional
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ Profile still created
- ✅ Autofill still works
- ✅ No barriers to conversion

### Authenticated User - First Time

1. User logs in (separate auth flow)
2. Navigates to booking
3. Completes steps 1-3
4. **Step 4:** System detects auth → Checks for profile by auth_user_id
5. No profile found → Checks email
6. **Scenario A:** Email matches guest profile
   - System links guest profile to auth account
   - Autofill prompt appears
   - All booking history preserved
7. **Scenario B:** New email
   - No autofill prompt
   - Fills form manually
8. Submit → Profile created with auth_user_id
9. Booking saved and linked to auth profile

**Result:**
- ✅ Guest profiles automatically claimed
- ✅ Booking history preserved
- ✅ Profile linked to auth account
- ✅ Seamless migration

### Authenticated User - Returning

1. User logs in
2. Navigates to booking
3. Completes steps 1-3
4. **Step 4:** System detects auth → Finds profile by auth_user_id instantly
5. Autofill prompt appears immediately
6. Clicks "Use Saved Information"
7. All fields autofill
8. Submit → Profile updated, bookings incremented
9. Booking saved

**Result:**
- ✅ Instant profile lookup (no email needed)
- ✅ Faster checkout
- ✅ Secure account link
- ✅ Order history accessible

## Database Schema

### Customers Table (Updated)

```sql
customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  address_line1 TEXT,
  address_suburb TEXT,
  address_city TEXT,
  auth_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),  -- NEW
  total_bookings INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_customers_email_lower` (unique, case-insensitive)
- `idx_customers_auth_user_id` (fast auth lookup)
- `idx_customers_auth_user_unique` (one profile per auth user)

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Get customer by auth user
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE auth_user_id = 'auth-uuid';

-- Get all bookings for auth user
SELECT b.* FROM bookings b
JOIN customers c ON b.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.auth_user_id = 'auth-uuid'
ORDER BY b.booking_date DESC;

-- Count guest vs auth users
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN auth_user_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as guest_customers,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN auth_user_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as auth_customers
FROM customers;
```

## Benefits

### For Guests (No Change)
✅ **No login required** - Checkout works same as before
✅ **Email-based profiles** - Autofill for returning guests
✅ **Can claim later** - Guest profile linkable to auth account
✅ **No friction** - Zero barriers to conversion

### For Authenticated Users (Enhanced)
✅ **Automatic linking** - Profile linked to auth account
✅ **Secure** - Profile tied to authenticated identity
✅ **Instant lookup** - No email entry needed
✅ **Order history** - Easy to query all bookings
✅ **Profile management** - Can edit in account dashboard (future)

### For Business
✅ **Higher conversion** - Guest checkout preserved
✅ **Better data** - Auth users have verified emails
✅ **Analytics** - Track auth vs guest conversion
✅ **Marketing** - Separate lists for auth/guest users
✅ **Account features** - Foundation for user dashboards

## Migration & Linking

### Guest → Auth Profile Migration

When a guest profile is claimed by auth user:

```sql
-- Before: Guest profile
{
  id: "uuid-1",
  email: "user@example.com",
  auth_user_id: NULL,  -- Guest
  total_bookings: 3
}

-- After: User logs in and books
{
  id: "uuid-1",  -- SAME ID
  email: "user@example.com",
  auth_user_id: "auth-uuid-123",  -- NOW LINKED
  total_bookings: 4  -- INCREMENTED
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All booking history preserved
- ✅ Same customer ID
- ✅ Profile claimed by auth account
- ✅ Seamless transition

## API Behavior

### GET /api/customers?email={email}

**Without Auth (Guest):**
```javascript
// Request from guest user
GET /api/customers?email=test@example.com

// Response
{
  ok: true,
  exists: true,
  customer: { ...profile },
  isAuthenticated: false
}
```

**With Auth:**
```javascript
// Request from authenticated user
GET /api/customers?email=test@example.com
// Auth token in cookies automatically detected

// Response (if profile found by auth_user_id)
{
  ok: true,
  exists: true,
  customer: { ...profile, auth_user_id: "uuid" },
  isAuthenticated: true
}
```

### POST /api/customers

**Guest User:**
```javascript
// Creates profile with auth_user_id = NULL
{
  email: "guest@test.com",
  auth_user_id: null,  // Guest
  ...
}
```

**Authenticated User:**
```javascript
// Creates profile with auth_user_id linked
{
  email: "auth@test.com",
  auth_user_id: "auth-uuid",  // Linked
  ...
}
```

## No Breaking Changes

✅ **Guest checkout preserved** - Works identically
✅ **Auth is optional** - No forced registration
✅ **Column nullable** - Backwards compatible
✅ **Email still works** - Fallback for guests
✅ **API compatible** - Same endpoints, enhanced logic
✅ **Frontend unchanged** - No UI changes required

## Security

✅ **Token validation** - Auth tokens verified with Supabase
✅ **Cookie-based** - Secure, httpOnly cookies
✅ **Graceful fallback** - Invalid token = guest user
✅ **No breaking** - Failed auth check doesn't break booking
✅ **RLS enabled** - Row level security on customers table

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Run this
-- File: supabase/add-auth-to-customers.sql
```

### 2. Verify Column Added

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'customers' 
AND column_name = 'auth_user_id';

-- Should show: auth_user_id | uuid | YES
```

### 3. Deploy Code

- Code already implements auth detection
- No frontend changes needed
- Works immediately after deployment

### 4. Test Flows

**Test Guest:**
1. Logout or use incognito
2. Complete booking
3. Check database - auth_user_id should be NULL

**Test Auth (if you have auth UI):**
1. Login to Supabase Auth
2. Complete booking
3. Check database - auth_user_id should be populated
