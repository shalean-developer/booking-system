## Accessibility Compliance

✅ **WCAG AA Compliant:**
- Proper contrast ratios (text, icons, buttons)
- Touch targets ≥44px
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- Semantic HTML structure
- `aria-live` regions for dynamic content

✅ **Motion Preferences:**
- All Framer Motion animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Graceful degradation for users who prefer reduced motion

## Technical Implementation

**Dependencies Used:**
- Framer Motion (already installed)
- Lucide React icons (already installed)
- TailwindCSS (existing)
- No new dependencies required

**Performance Considerations:**
- UseMemo for price calculations
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Optimized animations with GPU acceleration
- Conditional rendering for mobile/desktop

## Navigation Flow (Unchanged)

✅ All route logic preserved:
- `/booking/service/select` → Step 1: Service Selection
- Select service → `/booking/service/{slug}/details` → Step 2

✅ Data flow unchanged:
- Uses existing `useBooking` hook
- State management unchanged
- All form logic preserved

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop Testing:**
   - Verify stepper is centered
   - Test service card hover/click interactions
   - Verify booking summary is sticky
   - Test price updates with animations

2. **Mobile Testing:**
   - Verify price chip appears bottom-right
   - Test chip tap interaction
   - Verify slide-over opens smoothly
   - Test ESC key and backdrop click to close
   - Verify focus returns to chip
   - Test body scroll prevention

3. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Screen reader navigation
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Focus indicators visible
   - ARIA attributes properly announced
   - Reduced motion preferences respected

4. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile
   - Verify animations work smoothly

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with CSS Grid support
- Framer Motion requires modern JavaScript
- Fallback for older browsers via Tailwind
