3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Script
1. Copy the contents of `supabase/delete-all-bookings-fresh-start.sql`
2. Paste into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)

### Step 3: Review Results

## üîß Method 2: Delete Tables Manually

If you prefer to delete one table at a time:

### Step 1: Delete Booking Notes
```sql
DELETE FROM booking_notes;
SELECT 'booking_notes deleted: ' || COUNT(*) FROM booking_notes;
```

### Step 2: Delete Bookings
```sql
DELETE FROM bookings;
SELECT 'bookings deleted: ' || COUNT(*) FROM bookings;
```

### Step 3: Delete Customer Ratings
```sql
DELETE FROM customer_ratings;
SELECT 'customer_ratings deleted: ' || COUNT(*) FROM customer_ratings;
```

### Step 4: Delete Cleaner Reviews
```sql
DELETE FROM cleaner_reviews;
SELECT 'cleaner_reviews deleted: ' || COUNT(*) FROM cleaner_reviews;
```

### Step 5: Delete Recurring Schedules
```sql
DELETE FROM recurring_schedules;
SELECT 'recurring_schedules deleted: ' || COUNT(*) FROM recurring_schedules;
```

### Step 6: Reset Customer Booking Counts (Optional)
```sql
UPDATE customers SET total_bookings = 0;
SELECT 'Customer counts reset' as status;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Deletion Order

**IMPORTANT**: You must delete in this exact order to avoid foreign key constraint errors:

1. **booking_notes** (references bookings)
2. **bookings** (references customer_ratings & cleaner_reviews)
3. **customer_ratings** (now safe - no references)
4. **cleaner_reviews** (now safe - no references)
5. **recurring_schedules** (independent)

### ‚ùå Why Order Matters

If you try to delete `customer_ratings` before `bookings`, you'll get an error:
```
ERROR: 23503: update or delete on table "customer_ratings" 
violates foreign key constraint "bookings_customer_rating_id_fkey" 
on table "bookings"
```

This is because `bookings` still has references to `customer_ratings`.

## üîç Verify Deletion

After running the deletion, verify everything is clean:

```sql
-- Should all return 0
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings) as bookings,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recurring_schedules) as recurring,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_ratings) as ratings,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cleaner_reviews) as reviews,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM booking_notes) as notes;

-- Should return your customer and cleaner counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) as customers,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cleaners) as cleaners;
```

---

## üéâ After Deletion

Once deletion is complete:

1. ‚úÖ All old bookings with incorrect amounts are removed
2. ‚úÖ Customer and cleaner profiles are intact
3. ‚úÖ Ready to create new bookings with correct pricing
4. ‚úÖ New bookings will show proper amounts:
   - Customer bookings: R390+ with R40 service fee
   - Admin one-time: Correct totals with service fee
   - Admin recurring: Correct totals with R0 service fee

---

## üìä Testing New Bookings

After deletion, test the system:

1. **Customer Booking Flow**:
   - Go to `/booking/service/select`
   - Create a new booking
   - Verify amounts show correctly in admin dashboard
   - Expected: R390+ total, R40 service fee

2. **Admin One-Time Booking**:
   - Go to `/admin` ‚Üí Bookings ‚Üí Create Booking
   - Create a one-time booking
   - Verify amounts show correctly
   - Expected: Correct total with service fee

3. **Admin Recurring Booking**:
   - Go to `/admin` ‚Üí Bookings ‚Üí Create Recurring
   - Create a recurring booking
   - Verify amounts show correctly
   - Expected: Correct total with R0.00 service fee

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: Foreign Key Constraint Violation
**Solution**: Make sure you're deleting in the correct order (see "Correct Deletion Order" above)

### Error: Permission Denied
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as the database owner or have appropriate permissions

### Error: Table Does Not Exist
**Solution**: Some tables might not exist if you haven't created any bookings yet. This is normal, just skip those tables.
