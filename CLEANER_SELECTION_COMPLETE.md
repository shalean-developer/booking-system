## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Database Setup

1. Create Supabase project
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
3. Run `supabase/seed.sql` for sample data (optional)

See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cleaners Available
1. Complete steps 1-4
2. Enter address (e.g., "Cape Town")
3. Step 5 shows available cleaners
4. Select a cleaner
5. Proceed to review and pay

### Scenario 2: No Cleaners Available
1. Complete steps 1-4  
2. Enter address with no cleaners
3. Step 5 shows "Choose for Me" option
4. Click "Choose for Me"
5. Proceed to review with manual assignment
6. Admin receives email notification for manual assignment

### Scenario 3: All Cleaners Booked
1. Complete steps 1-4
2. Select date when all cleaners are booked
3. Step 5 shows "Choose for Me" option
4. Same flow as Scenario 2

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

### Customer Email
- Shows cleaner assignment status
- **Manual assignment**: Yellow notice about 24-hour contact
- **Selected cleaner**: Green confirmation message

### Admin Email
- **Manual assignment**: Red alert to assign cleaner
- Shows cleaner ID if selected
- Updated action items for manual assignment

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Availability Logic

```typescript
// 1. Get cleaners in the area
SELECT * FROM cleaners 
WHERE areas @> ARRAY['Cape Town'] 
AND is_active = true

// 2. Get bookings for the date
SELECT cleaner_id FROM bookings
WHERE booking_date = '2025-10-29'

// 3. Filter out booked cleaners
available = cleaners.filter(
  c => !bookedCleanerIds.includes(c.id)
)
```

### Manual Assignment Flow

When `cleaner_id === 'manual'`:
1. User selects "Choose for Me"
2. `cleaner_id` set to `'manual'` string
3. Booking proceeds normally
4. Database stores `'manual'` as cleaner_id
5. Admin email includes special alert
6. Staff manually assigns cleaner later

---

## 🎨 Styling & Animations

- **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions
- **Staggered animations** for cleaner cards
- **Scale effect** on hover
- **Loading skeletons** while fetching
- **Color-coded status** (green/amber) for assignments
- **Responsive design** across all devices
