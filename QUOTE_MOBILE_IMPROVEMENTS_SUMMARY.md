# Quote Form Mobile Responsiveness - Quick Summary

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### Files Modified
1. `app/booking/quote/page.tsx` - Main quote form
2. `app/booking/quote/confirmation/page.tsx` - Confirmation page

### Key Mobile Improvements

#### 📱 Spacing & Layout
- **Reduced padding** across all sections for better space utilization on small screens
- **Responsive gaps** in grids (2-4 units on mobile, 3-6 on tablet, 4-8 on desktop)
- **Compact card headers** with responsive padding
- **Optimized vertical spacing** (reduced from 6 to 4 units on mobile)

#### 🎯 Typography
- **Page title**: `2xl → 3xl → 4xl` (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- **Section titles**: `lg → xl` (mobile → desktop)  
- **Body text**: `xs → sm` or `sm → base` scaling
- **Badges and labels**: Smaller on mobile for better fit

#### 🔘 Interactive Elements
- **Service cards**: Reduced from `p-8` to `p-3 → p-5 → p-8`
- **Extra service buttons**: Icons sized `16x16 → 20x20 → 24x24`
- **Touch feedback**: Added `active:scale-95` for better mobile interaction
- **Button text**: Shortened labels on mobile (e.g., "Continue" vs "Continue to Contact Details")

#### 🎨 Visual Enhancements
- **Icons**: Responsive sizing throughout (4x4 → 5x5, 7x7 → 10x10, etc.)
- **Border radius**: More subtle on mobile (`rounded-lg → rounded-xl`)
- **Selection indicators**: Properly scaled across breakpoints

#### 📝 Content Optimization
- **Header**: 
  - "Cleaning Services" text hidden on extra small screens
  - "Back to Home" text hidden on mobile (icon only)
- **Buttons**: Context-aware text (e.g., "Home" vs "Back to Home", "Book Now" vs "Start Full Booking")
- **Messages**: Truncated for mobile while keeping key information
