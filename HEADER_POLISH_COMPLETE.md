      height={40}
      className="w-10 h-10 object-cover"
      onError={(e) => {
        // Automatic fallback to droplets icon
        const target = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
        target.style.display = 'none';
        const parent = target.parentElement;
        if (parent) {
          parent.innerHTML = '<svg class="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600">...</svg>';
        }
      }}
    />
  </div>
