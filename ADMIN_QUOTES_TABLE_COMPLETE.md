# Admin Quotations Table - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Quotations Management section in the Admin Dashboard. Admins can now view, manage, and track all quote requests submitted through the booking flow.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Quotes Management Section 📋
**File**: `components/admin/quotes-section.tsx`

A full-featured quotes management interface with:
- **Data Table Display**: Shows all quote requests with detailed information
- **Search Functionality**: Search by customer name, email, phone, or quote ID
- **Status Filtering**: Filter quotes by status (Pending, Contacted, Converted, Expired)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large lists of quotes efficiently
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses SWR for automatic data revalidation

#### Columns Displayed:
- Quote ID (QT-XXXXX format)
- Customer information (name, email, phone)
- Service type
- Service details (bedrooms, bathrooms, extras)
- Estimated price
- Status badge with color coding
- Creation date and time

#### Actions Available:
- 👁️ **View Details**: Full quote information in a modal
- ✏️ **Edit**: Update status and add notes
- 📧 **Email Customer**: Quick mailto link
- 🗑️ **Delete**: Remove quote with confirmation

### 2. Admin API Route 🔌
**File**: `app/api/admin/quotes/route.ts`

RESTful API endpoints for quote management:

#### GET `/api/admin/quotes`
- Fetch quotes with pagination
- Search by customer details or quote ID
- Filter by status
- Returns paginated results with total count

#### PUT `/api/admin/quotes`
- Update quote status (pending → contacted → converted/expired)
- Add or update admin notes
- Update estimated price if needed

#### DELETE `/api/admin/quotes`
- Remove quote from database
- Requires quote ID

**Security**: All endpoints require admin authentication via `isAdmin()` check.

### 3. Dashboard Integration 📊
**File**: `app/admin/admin-client.tsx`

Added new "Quotes" tab to the admin dashboard:
- Lazy-loaded component for optimal performance
- Positioned between "Bookings" and "Customers" tabs
- Follows consistent design patterns with other admin sections

### 4. Statistics Dashboard Enhancement 📈
**Files**: 
- `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts`
- `components/admin/stats-section.tsx`

Added quote statistics to the dashboard overview:
- **Total Quotes**: All-time count
- **Pending**: Awaiting admin action
- **Contacted**: Admin has reached out
- **Converted**: Successfully turned into bookings

The stats card displays all metrics in an easy-to-read grid format with color-coded values.
