## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```

Or run the SQL directly in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql

```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Storage in your Supabase project
2. Click "Create a new bucket"
3. Name: `review-photos`
4. Set as **Public** (for public read access)
5. Add storage policies:
   - Allow authenticated users to upload
   - Allow public read access

**Storage Policies to Add:**
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload review photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'review-photos');

-- Allow public read
CREATE POLICY "Public can view review photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'review-photos');
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Required for email notifications
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@shalean.co.za
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@shalean.co.za

# For dashboard links in emails

```

### 4. Restart Development Server

npm run dev
```
