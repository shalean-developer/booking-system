# Custom Recurring Frequency - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented custom recurring frequency support, allowing admins and customers to select multiple days per week for recurring bookings (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Database Changes

**File**: `supabase/migrations/add-custom-recurring-frequency.sql`

- Added `days_of_week INTEGER[]` column to `recurring_schedules` table
- Updated frequency CHECK constraint to include 'custom-weekly' and 'custom-bi-weekly'
- Added validation constraint to ensure `days_of_week` is used correctly
- Created index for custom frequencies
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing schedules

### ✅ TypeScript Types

**File**: `types/recurring.ts`

- Updated `Frequency` type: Added 'custom-weekly' and 'custom-bi-weekly'
- Added `days_of_week?: number[]` to RecurringSchedule interface
- Added `days_of_week?: number[]` to CreateBookingFormData interface
- Added custom frequency options to FREQUENCY_OPTIONS:
  - Custom Weekly: "Every week on selected days"
  - Custom Bi-weekly: "Every other week on selected days"

### ✅ Backend Logic

**File**: `lib/recurring-bookings.ts`

**New Functions**:
- `calculateCustomWeeklyDates()`: Generates dates for all selected days each week
- `calculateCustomBiWeeklyDates()`: Generates bi-weekly dates for all selected days

**Updated Functions**:
- `calculateBookingDatesForMonth()`: Now handles custom-weekly and custom-bi-weekly
- `validateRecurringSchedule()`: Validates custom frequency requirements

**Logic**:
- Custom weekly: Finds all occurrences of selected days in the month
- Custom bi-weekly: Calculates bi-weekly occurrences for each selected day
- Results are sorted chronologically

### ✅ API Updates

**File**: `app/api/admin/bookings/create/route.ts`

- Updated `scheduleData` to handle `days_of_week` for custom frequencies
- Sets `day_of_week` to null for custom frequencies
- Sets `days_of_week` to null for non-custom frequencies
- Validation automatically handled by existing `validateRecurringSchedule()` function

**Files**: Booking generation APIs automatically work because they use `calculateBookingDatesForMonth()`:
- `app/api/admin/recurring-schedules/[id]/generate/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/recurring-schedules/generate-all/route.ts`

### ✅ Admin Dashboard UI

**File**: `components/admin/create-booking-dialog.tsx`

- Added `days_of_week: []` to initial form state
- Added multi-day selector with checkboxes for custom frequencies
- Shows selected days as badges
- Grid layout: 2 columns, clean UI
- Conditional rendering based on frequency type

**File**: `components/admin/edit-recurring-schedule-dialog.tsx`

- Added `days_of_week` to form initialization
- Added same multi-day selector as create dialog
- Properly loads existing custom schedules for editing
- Unique IDs for edit dialog checkboxes (`edit-day-${value}`)

**File**: `components/admin/recurring-schedules-section.tsx`

- Updated schedule display to show multiple days for custom frequencies
- Format: "Every week on Mon, Wed, Fri at 9:00 AM"
- Abbreviated day names for better display

### ✅ Cleaner Dashboard Updates

**Files**: Updated Booking interfaces in all cleaner components:
- `components/cleaner/booking-card.tsx`
- `components/cleaner/my-bookings.tsx`
- `components/cleaner/available-bookings.tsx`
- `components/cleaner/booking-details-modal.tsx`

**Updates**:
- Added custom frequency types to type definitions
- Added `days_of_week?: number[]` to recurring_schedule interface
- Updated `getFrequencyLabel()` to handle custom frequencies
- Updated booking details modal to display multiple days
- Shows: "Repeats on: Monday, Wednesday, Friday"

## Features

### Frequency Options

1. **Weekly** - Single day each week (existing)
2. **Bi-weekly** - Single day every other week (existing)
3. **Monthly** - Same day each month (existing)
4. **Custom Weekly** - Multiple days each week (NEW)
5. **Custom Bi-weekly** - Multiple days every other week (NEW)

### Custom Weekly Example

**Schedule**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 9:00 AM
**Generates**: 12-13 bookings per month (3 days × 4 weeks + 0-1 extra days)

### Custom Bi-weekly Example

**Schedule**: Tuesday, Thursday at 2:00 PM (starting Jan 1)
**Generates**: 4-6 bookings per month (2 days × 2 weeks)

## Database Migration

### Migration File
`supabase/migrations/add-custom-recurring-frequency.sql`

### Apply Migration

**Option 1: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy migration SQL from file
3. Execute

**Option 2: Supabase CLI**
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

**Option 3: Direct SQL**
```sql
-- Run the migration file directly
```

### Verification

```sql
-- Check column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'recurring_schedules' 
AND column_name = 'days_of_week';

-- Check constraint exists
SELECT constraint_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE table_name = 'recurring_schedules' 
AND constraint_name LIKE '%custom%';
```

## Usage Examples

### Create Custom Weekly Schedule (Admin)

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Bookings
2. Click "Create Booking"
3. Select "Recurring Schedule"
4. Choose frequency: "Custom Weekly"
5. Check multiple days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
6. Set time: 9:00 AM
7. Fill in other details
8. Submit

### Create Custom Bi-weekly Schedule (Admin)

1. Same as above but select "Custom Bi-weekly"
2. Selected days repeat every other week
3. Pattern maintains from start date

### View in Cleaner Dashboard

Cleaners see:
- Badge: "Custom Weekly" or "Custom Bi-weekly"
- Details modal shows: "Repeats on: Monday, Wednesday, Friday"

## Technical Details

### Data Storage

```typescript
// Custom weekly example
{
  frequency: 'custom-weekly',
  day_of_week: null,  // Not used for custom
  days_of_week: [1, 3, 5],  // Monday, Wednesday, Friday
  preferred_time: '09:00'
}

// Regular weekly example (unchanged)
{
  frequency: 'weekly',
  day_of_week: 1,  // Monday
  days_of_week: null,
  preferred_time: '09:00'
}
```

### Validation Rules

1. **Custom frequencies**: `days_of_week` must be non-null and non-empty
2. **Regular frequencies**: `days_of_week` must be null
3. **Days range**: Values must be 0-6 (Sunday=0, Saturday=6)
4. **No duplicates**: Database stores unique days, UI prevents duplicates

### Date Calculation Logic

**Custom Weekly**:
```typescript
// Iterate through each day of month
// If day's weekday is in selected days, add to results
// Typically generates 12-13 bookings per month for 3 days
```

**Custom Bi-weekly**:
```typescript
// For each selected day:
//   Find first occurrence after start date
//   Add 14 days repeatedly
//   Filter by month range
// Typically generates 4-8 bookings per month for 2-4 days
```

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Old frequency types still supported
- ✅ Migration is additive (no data loss)
- ✅ UI gracefully handles both old and new formats

## Benefits

### For Admins
- Flexible scheduling options
- Single schedule for multiple days
- Easier to manage than multiple schedules
- Clear visual representation of custom schedules

### For Cleaners

- Better understanding of customer needs
- Clear badges identify custom schedules
- Full details in booking modal

### For Customers
- More convenient booking options

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Analytics**: Track adoption of custom frequencies
2. **Templates**: Save custom day patterns as templates
3. **Restrictions**: Limit days per week if needed
4. **Pricing**: Custom pricing for multi-day schedules
5. **Reports**: Show custom schedule patterns in reports

## Support

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Migration fails with constraint error
**Solution**: Ensure existing schedules have valid data, run migration again

**Issue**: Days not saving
**Solution**: Check that frequency is set to custom-weekly or custom-bi-weekly

**Issue**: Bookings not generating
**Solution**: Verify days_of_week array is not empty, check start date

### Validation Messages

- "At least one day must be selected for custom frequency"
- "Invalid day of week selected"
- Automatic validation prevents empty selections

## Summary

✅ **Database**: Migration adds `days_of_week` column with constraints
✅ **Types**: Full TypeScript support for custom frequencies  
✅ **Logic**: Date calculation for multi-day patterns
✅ **APIs**: Automatic support through existing infrastructure
✅ **Admin UI**: Multi-day selector with checkboxes and badges
✅ **Cleaner UI**: Display custom frequency information
✅ **Testing**: All components tested, no linter errors
✅ **Compatibility**: Existing schedules work unchanged

**Status**: READY FOR PRODUCTION 🚀

The system now supports custom recurring frequencies with multiple days per week, providing flexible scheduling options for both weekly and bi-weekly patterns.
