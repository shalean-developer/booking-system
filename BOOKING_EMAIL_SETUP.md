# üìß Booking Flow & Email Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the setup of the booking flow with email notifications for both customers and admin.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Complete Booking Flow** (Step 1 ‚Üí Confirmation)
The booking flow now works seamlessly from start to finish:
- **Step 1**: Service Selection (`/booking/service/select`)
- **Step 2**: Home Details (bedrooms, bathrooms, extras)
- **Step 3**: Schedule (date and time selection)
- **Step 4**: Contact & Address information
- **Step 5**: Review & Confirm
- **Final**: Confirmation Page

### 2. **Email System Enhanced**
Two email types are now sent on booking submission:

#### Customer Confirmation Email
- Professional branded email with Shalean branding
- Complete booking details (service, date, time, address)
- Pricing breakdown
- Booking ID for reference
- Contact information

#### Admin Notification Email
- **NEW!** Urgent notification to admin when a booking is submitted
- Customer contact information prominently displayed
- Complete booking details
- Action items checklist
- Clearly marked as requiring attention

### 3. **Email Configuration Improvements**
- Sender email now uses environment variable (`SENDER_EMAIL`)
- Admin email configurable via `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable
- Fallback to safe defaults if not configured
- Better error handling and logging

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project:

```bash
# Resend API Configuration
# Get your API key from https://resend.com
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Admin Email Configuration
# This email will receive notifications when new bookings are submitted
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@shalean.com

# Sender Email Configuration
# This should be your verified domain email
# For testing, you can use: onboarding@resend.dev
SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@shalean.com
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `.env.local` file is automatically ignored by git for security.

### Step 2: Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (includes 3,000 emails/month free, then $0.40 per 1,000 emails)
3. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
4. Create a new API key:
   - Name it: "Shalean Cleaning App"
   - Copy the generated key
5. Paste it into your `.env.local` file as `RESEND_API_KEY`

### Step 3: Configure Email Addresses

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Replace with your actual admin email where you want to receive booking notifications
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@yourdomain.com

# For testing, you can use Resend's test address
SENDER_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev

# For production, use your verified domain
# SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@shalean.com
```

### Step 4: Verify Domain (Production Only)

For production, verify your own domain in Resend:

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `shalean.com`)
4. Follow DNS verification instructions
5. Update `SENDER_EMAIL` in `.env.local` to use your domain

### Issue: Navigation Not Working

**Solution**:

## üé® Customization

### Modify Email Templates

Edit `lib/email.ts` to customize:

1. **Customer Email Template**
   - Function: `generateBookingConfirmationEmail()`
   - Line: ~55

2. **Admin Email Template**
   - Function: `generateAdminBookingNotificationEmail()`
   - Line: ~154

### Change Email Styling

Both email templates use inline CSS. Modify the `<style>` tags in the HTML templates:

```typescript
const html = `
  <style>
    .header { background-color: #0C53ED; ... }
    .content { background-color: #f9f9f9; ... }
    // ... customize colors, fonts, etc.
  </style>
`;
```

### Add More Email Types

Create new email generator functions in `lib/email.ts`:

```typescript
export function generateReminderEmail(booking: BookingState): EmailData {
  // Implementation here
}

export function generateCancellationEmail(booking: BookingState): EmailData {
  // Implementation here
}
```
