# Paystack Callback Fix - CRITICAL

## Issue Summary

**Problem:** After successful payment, the Paystack popup closed without triggering the booking flow, causing:
- ❌ No booking API call
- ❌ No database save
- ❌ No confirmation emails sent
- ❌ No redirect to confirmation page
- ✅ Paystack sent their own payment notification (confirming payment succeeded)

**Root Cause:** Incorrect callback syntax for `initializePayment` in react-paystack library.

---

## What Was Broken

### Original Code (Line 460 in `components/step-review.tsx`)

```typescript
initializePayment(onPaymentSuccess, onPaymentClose);
```

This syntax is **outdated** and doesn't work with the current version of react-paystack. The callbacks were never triggered, causing the payment success handler to never execute.

---

## The Fix

### Updated Code

```typescript
initializePayment({
  onSuccess: (reference) => {
    console.log('Payment success callback triggered');
    onPaymentSuccess(reference);
  },
  onClose: () => {
    console.log('Payment close callback triggered');
    onPaymentClose();
  },
});
```

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Pass callbacks as an **object** instead of separate parameters
2. ✅ Use `onSuccess` property (not direct function parameter)
3. ✅ Use `onClose` property (not direct function parameter)
4. ✅ Added console logs to confirm callbacks are triggered

---

## Why This Matters

### Before Fix:
```
User pays → Paystack confirms → Popup closes → NOTHING HAPPENS
```

### After Fix:
```
User pays → Paystack confirms → Popup closes → onPaymentSuccess fires →
  → Verify payment → Save to database → Send emails → Redirect to confirmation
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### Expected Console Output (After Payment)

**Browser Console:**
```
=== PAYSTACK BUTTON CLICKED ===
Calling initializePayment from PaystackConsumer
Initializing payment with callbacks...
[Paystack popup opens]
[User completes payment]
Payment success callback triggered ← NEW! This confirms callback works
=== PAYMENT SUCCESS HANDLER CALLED ===
Payment reference received: { reference: 'BK-...' }
Step 1: Starting payment verification...
✅ Step 4: Payment verified successfully, submitting booking...
Step 5: Booking response received
✅ Step 7: Booking successful! Redirecting...
```

**Server Console:**
```
=== BOOKING API CALLED ===
Step 1: Validating environment configuration...
✅ Environment validation passed
Step 2: Parsing booking data...
✅ Payment reference found
Step 3: Re-verifying payment with Paystack...
✅ Payment re-verified successfully
Step 4: Generated booking ID
Step 5: Saving booking to database...
✅ Booking saved to database successfully
Step 6: Sending confirmation emails...
✅ Customer confirmation email sent successfully
✅ Admin notification email sent successfully
Step 7: Booking completed successfully
```

## Verification Checklist

After the fix, verify:

- [ ] **Payment Success Callback Fires**
  - Look for: `Payment success callback triggered` in console

- [ ] **Booking API Called**
  - Look for: `=== BOOKING API CALLED ===` in server logs

- [ ] **Database Save**
  - Check Supabase `bookings` table for new record

- [ ] **Emails Sent**
  - Customer receives confirmation email
  - Admin receives notification email

- [ ] **Redirect Works**
  - User redirected to `/booking/confirmation`

- [ ] **Booking State Cleared**
  - localStorage cleared after successful booking

## Common Issues (If Still Not Working)

### Issue 1: "Payment success callback triggered" appears but nothing else happens

**Possible Causes:**
- Environment variables missing (check `.env.local`)
- Paystack re-verification failing
- Database connection issue
- Email service issue

**Check:** Server logs for specific error messages

### Issue 2: Callback still not firing

**Possible Causes:**
- React re-render issue (callback references changing)
- Browser cache (try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache and restart dev server
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue 3: Error after callback fires

**Possible Causes:**
- Server configuration issue
- Network error

**Check:** 
- Network tab in DevTools for failed requests
- Server terminal for error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Test the booking flow** end-to-end
2. **Verify** all 6 items in the checklist above
3. **Monitor** for any edge cases or errors
4. If issues persist, check server logs and share them for further debugging

## Technical Notes

### Why the Old Syntax Stopped Working

The react-paystack library updated their API to accept an options object instead of separate callback parameters. This is a **breaking change** in newer versions of the library.

**Old API (deprecated):**
```typescript
initializePayment(successCallback, closeCallback)
```

**New API (current):**
```typescript
initializePayment({
  onSuccess: successCallback,
  onClose: closeCallback,
})
```

### Alternative Implementation

You could also pass the callbacks directly in the config:

```typescript
const paystackConfig = {
  reference: paymentReference,
  email: state.email,
  amount: total * 100,
  publicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY || '',
  onSuccess: onPaymentSuccess,  // Add here
  onClose: onPaymentClose,      // Add here
};

// Then just call:
initializePayment();  // No parameters needed
```

However, the explicit object parameter approach is clearer and recommended.

**Status:** ✅ **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**

This fix is **essential** for the booking flow to work. Without it, no bookings will be saved regardless of successful payment.
