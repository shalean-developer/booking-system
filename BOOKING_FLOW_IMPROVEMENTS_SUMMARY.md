## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Required

1. **Success Page:**
   - Complete a booking and verify success page shows real data
   - Test with manual assignment bookings
   - Test with team bookings
   - Test resend confirmation button
   - Test download receipt button
   - Test error state when booking not found

2. **Form Validation:**
   - Try to proceed with 0 bedrooms (should fail)
   - Try to proceed with 0 bathrooms (should fail)
   - Enter invalid phone number (should show error)
   - Enter valid South African phone number

3. **Mobile UX:**
   - Verify chip only shows from step 2
   - Test on various mobile devices
   - Test slide-over panel functionality

## Metrics to Track

- Success page loads with real data: Target 100%
- Form validation prevents bad submissions: Target 0 invalid
- User completes flow without errors: Target >95%
- Mobile users can easily navigate: Target >90%
