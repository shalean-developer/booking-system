## 🔄 Pricing Logic Flow

### **For One-Time Bookings:**
1. **Manual Mode**: If `total_amount > 0`
   - Use provided `total_amount`, `service_fee`, `cleaner_earnings`
   - Convert to cents for database storage
   - Set `manual_pricing: true` in snapshot

2. **Auto Mode**: If `total_amount` is empty
   - Calculate using `calcTotalAsync()` with service type, bedrooms, bathrooms, extras
   - Convert to cents for database storage
   - Set `manual_pricing: false` in snapshot

### **For Recurring Bookings:**
1. **Manual Mode**: If `total_amount > 0`
   - Use provided `total_amount` and `cleaner_earnings`
   - **Always set `service_fee = 0`** (recurring rule)
   - Convert to cents for database storage

2. **Auto Mode**: If `total_amount` is empty
   - Calculate using `calcTotalAsync()` with frequency discounts
   - **Always set `service_fee = 0`** (recurring rule)
   - Convert to cents for database storage
