# âœ… Accepted Bookings Fix - COMPLETE!

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where accepted bookings disappeared from the cleaner dashboard after a cleaner accepted them.

## Root Cause
The "Upcoming" tab filter in `components/cleaner/my-bookings.tsx` only showed bookings with status `'pending'` or `'in-progress'`, but when a cleaner accepts a booking, the status changes to `'accepted'`, which was not included in the filter.

## Solution Applied

**File**: `components/cleaner/my-bookings.tsx`

**Changed from:**
```typescript
const upcomingBookings = bookings.filter(
  (b) => b.status === 'pending' || b.status === 'in-progress'
);
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
const upcomingBookings = bookings.filter(
  (b) => ['pending', 'accepted', 'on_my_way', 'in-progress'].includes(b.status)
);
```

## Booking Status Flow (Now Fixed)

1. **pending** - Booking is created by customer âœ… Shows in "Upcoming"
2. **accepted** - Cleaner has accepted the booking âœ… **NOW SHOWS** in "Upcoming"
3. **on_my_way** - Cleaner is traveling to location âœ… **NOW SHOWS** in "Upcoming"
4. **in-progress** - Cleaner has started the job âœ… Shows in "Upcoming"
5. **completed** - Job is finished âœ… Shows in "Completed"

## What This Fixes

- âœ… **Accepted bookings remain visible** in the cleaner's "My Bookings" tab
- âœ… **"On My Way" bookings remain visible** during travel
- âœ… **Complete booking workflow** is now visible from start to finish
- âœ… **Cleaners can track their bookings** through all active statuses

## Testing

After this fix:
1. Cleaner claims a booking â†’ appears in "My Bookings"
2. Cleaner accepts the booking â†’ **still visible** in "My Bookings"
3. Cleaner clicks "On My Way" â†’ **still visible** in "My Bookings"
4. Cleaner starts job â†’ **still visible** in "My Bookings"
5. Cleaner completes job â†’ moves to "Completed" tab

**The cleaner dashboard now properly shows all active bookings until completion!** ðŸŽ‰
