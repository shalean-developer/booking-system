# Dynamic Pricing System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive database-backed pricing management system that replaces all hardcoded prices with dynamic, admin-manageable pricing. The system includes price history tracking, scheduled price changes, service fees, and frequency discounts.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

**Created Tables:**
- `pricing_config` - Stores all pricing data with versioning and scheduling
- `pricing_history` - Automatic audit trail of all price changes
- Added columns to `bookings` table: `service_fee`, `frequency`, `frequency_discount`, `price_snapshot`

**Files:**
- `supabase/pricing-config-table.sql` - Complete schema with triggers and RLS policies
- `supabase/seed-pricing.sql` - Seed data with current hardcoded prices (23 records)
- `supabase/update-bookings-pricing.sql` - Booking table updates

**Features:**
- Price history with automatic logging via database triggers
- Scheduled price changes (set future effective dates)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for admin-only management
- Public read access to active pricing only

### 2. Backend Layer

**Created Files:**
- `lib/pricing-db.ts` - Database access layer with 5-minute caching
  - `fetchActivePricing()` - Get current prices with caching
  - `savePricing()` - Create/update pricing
  - `scheduleFuturePrice()` - Schedule price changes
  - `getScheduledPricing()` - View upcoming changes
  - `fetchPricingHistory()` - Get audit trail
  
**Updated Files:**
- `lib/pricing.ts` - Added async pricing functions
  - `getCurrentPricing()` - Fetch dynamic pricing from DB
  - `calcTotalAsync()` - Calculate with service fee + frequency discount
  - Kept old sync functions for backward compatibility

**API Endpoints:**
- `app/api/admin/pricing/route.ts`
  - GET: Fetch current and scheduled pricing
  - POST: Create new price or schedule future price
  - PUT: Update existing price
  - DELETE: Deactivate pricing (soft delete)
  - PATCH: Clear cache
  
- `app/api/admin/pricing/history/route.ts`
  - GET: Fetch price change history with filters

### 3. Admin UI Components

  - One-time / Weekly / Bi-weekly / Monthly
  - Shows discount badges
  - Visual feedback for selected frequency

**Updated Components:**

**Updated Types:**

## Database Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run Schema Migrations
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor (in order):
1. supabase/pricing-config-table.sql
2. supabase/update-bookings-pricing.sql
3. supabase/seed-pricing.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Data
```sql
-- Check seeded pricing
SELECT price_type, service_type, item_name, price 
FROM pricing_config 
WHERE is_active = true 
ORDER BY price_type, service_type;

-- Should return 23 active records
```

### Step 3: Test in Development
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. Click "Pricing" tab
4. Verify all prices loaded correctly
5. Try editing a price and saving

### Step 4: Test Booking Flow
1. Go to `/booking/service/select`
2. Select a service and proceed
3. On schedule step, select a frequency (e.g., Weekly)
4. Verify discount appears in booking summary
5. Complete booking and check database

## Price Snapshot Feature

Every booking saves a complete price snapshot in JSONB format:
```json
{
  "service": {
    "type": "Standard",
    "bedrooms": 2,
    "bathrooms": 1
  },
  "extras": ["Inside Fridge", "Inside Oven"],
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "service_fee": 50,
  "frequency_discount": 52.50,
  "subtotal": 350,
  "total": 347.50,
  "snapshot_date": "2025-10-18T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Historical bookings always show correct prices
- Price changes don't affect past bookings
- Complete audit trail for disputes
- Can reconstruct exact pricing at booking time

## Caching Strategy

- **5-minute cache** on pricing data
- Cache cleared automatically on any price update
- Manual cache clear available via API: `PATCH /api/admin/pricing`
- Fallback to hardcoded prices if database unavailable

## Security

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all pricing tables
- **Admin-only** write access (role check via `auth.users`)
- **Public read** access to active pricing only
- **Audit trail** tracks who changed what and when

## Backward Compatibility

- Old sync functions (`calcTotal`, `getServicePricing`) still work
- Hardcoded `PRICING` constant kept as fallback
- Existing code will continue to work during transition
- New code should use async functions for dynamic pricing
