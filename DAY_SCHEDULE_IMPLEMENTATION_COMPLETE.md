# Day-of-Week Cleaner Availability System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive day-of-week scheduling system for cleaners with admin management, automatic time slot blocking on booking assignment, and integration with the existing availability toggle system.

## System Requirements (Implemented)

1. ✅ **Day schedule works WITH master toggle**: Both must be true for availability
2. ✅ **Auto-unavailability**: Cleaner time slots marked as booked when assigned
3. ✅ **Admin-only management**: Only admins can edit day-of-week schedules
4. ✅ **No show when off**: Cleaners filtered out on their off days

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations

#### 1. `supabase/migrations/add-cleaner-day-schedule.sql`
- Added 7 boolean columns to cleaners table (one per day)
- All default to `true` (available all days initially)
- Created indexes for efficient day-based queries
- Added column comments for documentation

**Columns Added:**
- `available_monday`
- `available_tuesday`
- `available_wednesday`
- `available_thursday`
- `available_friday`
- `available_saturday`
- `available_sunday`

#### 2. `supabase/migrations/create-cleaner-time-slots.sql`
- Created `cleaner_time_slots` table to track bookings by time slot
- Implemented trigger `update_cleaner_time_slot()` for auto-marking unavailable
- Handles booking assignment, cleaner changes, and booking status changes

**Table Structure:**
```sql
cleaner_time_slots (
  id UUID,
  cleaner_id UUID (FK -> cleaners),
  booking_id TEXT (FK -> bookings),
  date DATE,
  time_slot TIME,
  status TEXT ('booked', 'blocked', 'available'),
  duration_hours DECIMAL,
  created_at, updated_at
)
```

**Trigger Behavior:**
- When cleaner assigned to booking → Create time slot entry
- When cleaner changed → Free old cleaner's slot, book new cleaner's slot
- When cleaner unassigned → Free time slot
- When booking cancelled/completed → Free time slot

---

### Backend API Updates

#### 3. `lib/supabase.ts` - Updated `getAvailableCleaners()`
**New Logic:**
1. Calculate day of week from booking date
2. Query cleaners with 4 conditions:
   - In service area
   - `is_active = true`
   - `is_available = true` (master toggle)
   - `available_[day] = true` (works on that day)
3. Fetch booked time slots for that date
4. Return cleaners with their booked_times array

**Console Logging Added:**
- Shows which day being queried
- Shows number of cleaners found
- Helps with debugging

#### 4. `app/api/admin/cleaners/schedule/route.ts` - NEW
**Admin API for Schedule Management:**
- `PATCH` endpoint to update cleaner day schedule
- Validates admin access via `isAdmin()`
- Accepts schedule object: `{ monday: true, tuesday: false, ... }`
- Updates database and returns updated cleaner data
- Validates at least one day provided
- Logs schedule changes for audit trail

#### 5. `app/api/admin/bookings/assign/route.ts` - UPDATED
**Assignment API Enhancement:**
- Added day-of-week filtering logic
- Now fetches only cleaners who:
  - Are active
  - Have master toggle ON
  - Work on the booking's day of week
- Reduces unnecessary data transfer
- Prevents assignment to cleaners who don't work that day

---

### Frontend Components

#### 6. `components/admin/day-schedule-editor.tsx` - NEW
**Interactive Schedule Editor Component:**

**Features:**
- Visual day selector (Mon-Sun checkboxes)
- Select All / Deselect All button
- Shows active days count (X of 7 days selected)
- Validates at least one day selected
- Save button with loading state
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Color-coded active/inactive days

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  cleaner: {
    id, name,
    available_monday, available_tuesday, etc.
  },
  onUpdate?: () => void
}
```

#### 7. `components/admin/cleaners-section.tsx` - UPDATED
**Cleaner Interface Extended:**
Added day availability fields to TypeScript interface:
```typescript
interface Cleaner {
  // ... existing fields
  available_monday?: boolean;
  available_tuesday?: boolean;
  // ... etc for all 7 days
}
```

**Edit Dialog Enhanced:**
- Imported `DayScheduleEditor` component
- Added "Weekly Schedule" section in edit dialog
- Only shows when editing existing cleaner (not when creating new)
- Calls `fetchCleaners()` on schedule update to refresh data

**Location in Dialog:**
- After all cleaner fields
- Before DialogFooter
- Separated by border for visual clarity

## How It Works

### Admin Workflow

1. **Admin opens cleaners section** → Views list of all cleaners
2. **Clicks edit on a cleaner** → Edit dialog opens
3. **Scrolls to "Weekly Schedule" section** → Sees current schedule
4. **Toggles days on/off** → Modifies which days cleaner works
5. **Clicks "Save Schedule"** → API updates database
6. **Dialog refreshes** → Shows updated cleaner data

### System Behavior

#### When Booking is Created/Assigned:

1. **Customer selects date/time** for booking
2. **System calculates day of week** (e.g., Tuesday)
3. **Queries cleaners** where:
   - `available_tuesday = true`
   - `is_available = true`
   - `is_active = true`
   - Works in service area
4. **Displays only matching cleaners**
5. **Admin/Customer selects cleaner**
6. **Trigger automatically fires** → Creates time slot entry
7. **Cleaner now shows as booked** for that time slot

#### When Booking is Unassigned/Cancelled:

1. **Cleaner removed from booking**
2. **Trigger fires automatically**
3. **Time slot entry deleted**
4. **Cleaner available again** for that time

### Master Toggle + Day Schedule

The system uses **AND logic**:
```
Available = is_available (master) AND available_[day] AND is_active
```

**Examples:**
- Master ON + Wednesday ON → Available on Wednesday ✅
- Master OFF + Wednesday ON → NOT available ❌
- Master ON + Wednesday OFF → NOT available ❌
- Master OFF + Wednesday OFF → NOT available ❌

## Database Schema Changes

### Cleaners Table (Extended)
```sql
cleaners
├── ... existing columns
├── is_available (master toggle)
├── available_monday
├── available_tuesday
├── available_wednesday
├── available_thursday
├── available_friday
├── available_saturday
└── available_sunday
```

### New Table: cleaner_time_slots
```sql
cleaner_time_slots
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── cleaner_id (UUID, FK)
├── booking_id (TEXT, FK, nullable)
├── date (DATE)
├── time_slot (TIME)
├── status (TEXT: booked/blocked/available)
├── duration_hours (DECIMAL)
├── created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
└── updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)

Indexes:
- cleaner_id
- date
- status
- booking_id (where not null)
- (cleaner_id, date) composite
```

---

## Testing Guide

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Connect to Supabase and run:
supabase/migrations/add-cleaner-day-schedule.sql
supabase/migrations/create-cleaner-time-slots.sql
```

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT 
  column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'cleaners' 
  AND column_name LIKE 'available_%';

-- Check table exists
SELECT * FROM cleaner_time_slots LIMIT 1;

-- Check trigger exists
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_update_cleaner_time_slot';
```

### 2. Test Admin Schedule Management

1. **Login as admin** → Go to admin dashboard
2. **Navigate to Cleaners tab**
3. **Click edit on any cleaner**
4. **Scroll to "Weekly Schedule"**
5. **Toggle some days off** (e.g., turn off Saturday & Sunday)
6. **Click "Save Schedule"**
7. **Verify success toast appears**
8. **Close and reopen dialog** → Verify schedule persisted

### 3. Test Day Filtering

**Setup:**
- Set a cleaner to only work Monday-Friday
- Create a booking for Saturday

**Expected Result:**
- That cleaner should NOT appear in cleaner selection
- Only cleaners with `available_saturday = true` should appear

### 4. Test Auto Time Slot Booking

**Setup:**
- Assign a cleaner to a booking

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
-- Should see new entry in time slots table
SELECT 
  c.name,
  cts.date,
  cts.time_slot,
  cts.status,
  b.id as booking_id
FROM cleaner_time_slots cts
JOIN cleaners c ON c.id = cts.cleaner_id
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON b.id = cts.booking_id
ORDER BY cts.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. Test Master Toggle Integration

**Scenario 1: Master OFF, Day ON**
1. Cleaner has Monday enabled
2. Admin turns master toggle OFF
3. Try to book on Monday
4. **Expected**: Cleaner does NOT appear

**Scenario 2: Master ON, Day OFF**
1. Cleaner has master toggle ON
2. Admin sets Saturday = OFF
3. Try to book on Saturday
4. **Expected**: Cleaner does NOT appear

**Scenario 3: Both ON**
1. Both master and day enabled
2. **Expected**: Cleaner appears and can be booked

## Console Logs for Debugging

### Backend Logs

**getAvailableCleaners():**
```
🗓️ Fetching cleaners for 2025-10-25 (available_saturday) in Sandton
✅ Found 3 cleaners available on available_saturday
📋 Returning 3 cleaners with time slot info
```

**Schedule API:**
```
✅ Updated schedule for John Doe
📅 New schedule: { Mon: true, Tue: true, Wed: true, Thu: true, Fri: true, Sat: false, Sun: false }
```

**Assign API:**
```
📅 Filtering cleaners for 2025-10-25 (available_saturday)
```

---

## Migration Strategy for Existing Cleaners

All existing cleaners will default to:
- `available_monday = true`
- `available_tuesday = true`
- ... (all days true)

This means **no disruption** to current operations. Admins can then customize schedules as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Cleaners Not Showing Up

**Check:**
1. Is cleaner `is_active = true`?
2. Is cleaner `is_available = true` (master toggle)?
3. Does cleaner work on that day? (`available_[day] = true`)
4. Is cleaner in the service area?

**SQL Debug Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  is_active,
  is_available,
  available_monday,
  available_tuesday,
  available_wednesday,
  available_thursday,
  available_friday,
  available_saturday,
  available_sunday,
  areas
FROM cleaners
WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

### Time Slots Not Creating

**Check:**
1. Does trigger exist?
2. Is booking assigned to a cleaner?
3. Check database logs for errors

```sql
-- Verify trigger
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_update_cleaner_time_slot';
```

### Schedule Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Admin authentication
2. Browser console for errors
3. Network tab for API response
4. Backend logs for errors
