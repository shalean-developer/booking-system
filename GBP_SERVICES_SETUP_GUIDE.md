## Best Practices

### Service Naming
- Use consistent naming across all platforms
- Include location (Cape Town) in descriptions, not in service names
- Keep service names concise and clear

### Descriptions
- Always include "Cape Town" in descriptions
- Mention "trusted cleaners near you" for local SEO
- Include key benefits (same-day, eco-friendly, etc.)
- Keep descriptions under 200 characters for GBP

### Pricing
- Use "From [price]" format for transparency
- Update prices regularly if they change
- Include "Quote on request" for custom services

### Linking Services to Website
- Each service should link to its corresponding page on shalean.co.za
- Ensure all service pages exist before adding to GBP
- Use clean, SEO-friendly URLs

### Service Categories
- Primary category: "Cleaning Service" or "House Cleaning Service"
- Secondary categories: Add relevant categories like:
  - Office Cleaning Service
  - Deep Cleaning Service
  - Carpet Cleaning Service
  - Window Cleaning Service

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Review service descriptions for accuracy
- Check that all links work correctly
- Monitor service views and engagement

### Monthly
- Update pricing if changed
- Add new services as they're launched
- Review and optimize service descriptions based on performance

### Quarterly
- Audit all 36 services to ensure they're still active
- Update descriptions with seasonal keywords
- Review competitor services and adjust as needed

---

## Notes

- **Hidden Services:** Services marked as "HIDDEN PAGE" are for SEO purposes only. They may not appear in your main service menu but should still be added to GBP for maximum local SEO coverage.

- **Service Limits:** Google Business Profile allows up to 10 services in the main services section. For additional services, they'll appear in the "More services" section or in search results.

- **Service Photos:** Consider adding photos for each major service type to improve visibility and engagement.

- **Service Hours:** Some services may have specific availability (e.g., after-hours for office cleaning). Note these in descriptions if applicable.
