# Booking System Merge - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully merged the booking calculator into the main booking flow, creating a unified system with live pricing preview.

## What Was Done

### ✅ 1. Updated Pricing System (`lib/pricing.ts`)
- **Replaced multiplier-based pricing** with service-specific rates
- **New structure**:
  - Standard: R250 base + R20/bed + R30/bath
  - Deep: R1200 base + R180/bed + R250/bath
  - Moving: R980 base + R160/bed + R220/bath
  - Airbnb: R230 base + R18/bed + R26/bath
- **Updated extras** (removed "Water Plants", adjusted prices to R30-R40 range)
- **Added helper function**: `getServicePricing()` for retrieving rates
- **Updated calculation**: `calcTotal()` now uses service-specific bases

### ✅ 2. Redesigned Details Step (`components/step-details.tsx`)
- **New two-column layout**: Form left, live preview right
- **Interactive extras**: Button-style toggles with +/✓ indicators
- **Real-time calculations**: Price updates instantly
- **Detailed breakdown**: Shows base + bedrooms + bathrooms + extras
- **Service-specific hints**: Displays per-room rates based on service
- **Large total display**: Prominent R[amount] in primary color
- **Responsive design**: Sticky sidebar on desktop, adapts for mobile

### ✅ 3. Updated Booking Summary (`components/booking-summary.tsx`)
- **Service-specific breakdown**: Shows base price separately
- **Per-room calculations**: Displays count × rate for each
- **Updated extras display**: Uses new pricing structure
- **Consistent with new system**: Uses `getServicePricing()` helper

### ✅ 4. Removed Calculator Files
**Deleted:**
- `components/booking-form.tsx` (merged into step-details)
- `lib/pricingData.ts` (consolidated into lib/pricing.ts)
- `lib/priceCalculator.ts` (merged into lib/pricing.ts)
- `BOOKING_CALCULATOR_INTEGRATION.md` (outdated)

**Replaced:**
- `app/booking/calculator/page.tsx` - Now redirects to `/booking/service/select`

### ✅ 5. Updated Homepage CTAs (`app/page.tsx`)
- Changed "Calculate Price" to "Get Free Quote"
- Both buttons now direct to `/booking/service/select`
- Unified entry point for all bookings

### ✅ 6. Fixed Backup Files
- Updated Stepper component props in all backup files
- Changed from `current={state.step} total={5}` to `currentStep={state.step}`
- Ensures backward compatibility if backup is needed

### ✅ 7. Updated Quote Page
- Removed "Water Plants" from extras icon map
- Compatible with new pricing structure
- Quote page continues to function correctly
