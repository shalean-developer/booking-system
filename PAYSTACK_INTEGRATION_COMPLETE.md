# Paystack Payment Integration - Complete

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Paystack payment integration has been successfully implemented into the booking flow. Payment is now required before booking confirmation.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Payment Integration at Step 5 (Review)
**File**: `components/step-review.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Integrated `usePaystackPayment` hook from react-paystack
- Replaced "Confirm Booking" button with "Confirm & Pay R{amount}"
- Payment popup opens inline (no redirect)
- Added payment error handling and display
- Shows "Secure payment powered by Paystack" message
- Loading states during payment processing

**Payment Flow**:
1. User clicks "Confirm & Pay" button
2. Paystack popup appears with total amount
3. User enters payment details
4. Payment processed securely
5. On success: Payment verified → Booking created → Redirect to confirmation
6. On failure: Error shown, user can retry

### 2. Payment Verification API
**File**: `app/api/payment/verify/route.ts` (new)

**Features**:
- Verifies payment with Paystack API using secret key
- Checks payment status is "success"
- Converts amount from kobo to rands
- Returns detailed verification response
- Comprehensive error handling

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/payment/verify`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "reference": "BK-1234567890-abc123"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "success",
    "reference": "BK-1234567890-abc123",
    "amount": 350,
    "currency": "ZAR",
    "paid_at": "2025-10-16T10:30:00Z",
    "customer": {
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    }
  },
  "message": "Payment verified successfully"
}
```

### 3. Updated Bookings API
**File**: `app/api/bookings/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Now requires `paymentReference` in request body
- Re-verifies payment before confirming booking (extra security)
- Uses payment reference as booking ID
- Rejects bookings without valid payment

**Security**:
- Double verification: Once in frontend, once in backend
- Payment status checked before booking creation
- No bookings created without successful payment

### 4. TypeScript Type Updates
**File**: `types/booking.ts`

**Added**:
- `paymentReference?: string` to `BookingState`
- `PaystackVerificationResponse` interface with complete type safety

**Changes**:
- Updated messaging to confirm payment completion

- Changed email message to mention "receipt"
