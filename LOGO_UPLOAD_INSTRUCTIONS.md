# Logo Upload Instructions

## How to Add Your Logo to the Header

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo File

**Recommended Specifications:**
- **Format**: SVG (best) or PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels (square ratio preferred)
- **Colors**: Should work well on white background
- **File size**: Keep under 50KB for fast loading
- **Background**: Transparent or white

### Step 2: Save Your Logo

1. **Name your logo file**: `logo.svg` or `logo.png`
2. **Save location**: Place the file in the `public/` folder at your project root

```
Your Project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.svg          ‚Üê Save your logo here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Step 3: Verify the Logo

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit any page with the header (homepage, services, etc.)
3. Your logo should appear in the top-left corner
4. If the logo doesn't load, the system will show a fallback droplets icon

### File Path Examples

**Correct locations:**
```
‚úÖ public/logo.svg
‚úÖ public/logo.png
```

**Incorrect locations:**
```
‚ùå public/images/logo.svg
‚ùå src/logo.svg
‚ùå components/logo.svg
```

### Troubleshooting

**Logo not showing?**
- Check the file is named exactly `logo.svg` or `logo.png`
- Verify it's in the `public/` folder (not a subfolder)
- Make sure the file isn't corrupted
- Check browser console for any loading errors

**Logo looks blurry?**
- Use SVG format for crisp display at any size
- Ensure your PNG is at least 40x40 pixels
- Avoid upscaling small images

**Logo has wrong colors?**
- Use transparent background for best results
- Avoid dark colors that won't show on the light blue background
- Test how it looks on the light blue circle background

### Fallback Behavior

If your logo file is missing or fails to load:
- The system automatically shows a droplets icon
- No errors will appear to users
- The header continues to work normally
- You can fix the logo anytime by adding the file

### Design Tips

**Best practices:**
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use your brand colors
- Ensure good contrast against light backgrounds
- Consider how it looks in a circular frame

**Avoid:**
- Complex details that won't be visible at 40x40px
- Text that's too small to read
- Dark backgrounds that clash with the design

1. ‚úÖ The header will automatically display it
2. ‚úÖ It appears on all pages (homepage, services, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Works on both desktop and mobile
4. ‚úÖ Updates immediately without restarting the server
