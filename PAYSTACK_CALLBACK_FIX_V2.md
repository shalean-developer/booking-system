# Paystack Callback Fix V2 - FINAL SOLUTION

## Issue Summary

**Problem:** Paystack payment success callback was still not firing after the first fix attempt.

**Root Cause:** The `PaystackConsumer` expects callbacks to be **part of the configuration object**, not passed separately to `initializePayment()`.

---

## The Final Fix

### What Was Wrong

The `PaystackConsumer` component passes the entire config object (including callbacks) to Paystack, and then `initializePayment()` is called without parameters.

**Previous Attempt (V1):**
```typescript
// ❌ This didn't work - callbacks passed separately
initializePayment(successCallback, closeCallback);
```

### The Correct Solution (V2)

**Updated Code:**

```typescript
// ✅ Add callbacks to the config object
const paystackConfig = {
  reference: paymentReference,
  email: state.email,
  amount: total * 100,
  publicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY || '',
  currency: 'ZAR',
  channels: ['card'],
  metadata: { ... },
  
  // ✅ Callbacks are part of the config
  onSuccess: (reference: any) => {
    console.log('=== PAYMENT SUCCESS CALLBACK TRIGGERED ===');
    console.log('Reference received:', reference);
    onPaymentSuccess(reference);
  },
  onClose: () => {
    console.log('=== PAYMENT CLOSE CALLBACK TRIGGERED ===');
    onPaymentClose();
  },
};

// ✅ PaystackConsumer receives the full config
<PaystackConsumer {...paystackConfig}>
  {({initializePayment}) => (
    <Button onClick={() => {
      // ✅ Call without parameters - callbacks are in config
      initializePayment();
    }}>
      Pay Now
    </Button>
  )}
</PaystackConsumer>
```

## Files Modified

### `components/step-review.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `onSuccess` and `onClose` callbacks to `paystackConfig` object
2. ✅ Simplified `initializePayment()` call to use no parameters
3. ✅ Added detailed console logging for callback triggers

---

## Expected Behavior Now

### Browser Console Output (After Payment)

```
=== PAYSTACK BUTTON CLICKED ===
Calling initializePayment from PaystackConsumer
Initializing payment with callbacks in config...
[Paystack popup opens]
[User completes payment]
=== PAYMENT SUCCESS CALLBACK TRIGGERED ===  ← THIS SHOULD NOW APPEAR!
Reference received: { reference: 'BK-...' }
=== PAYMENT SUCCESS HANDLER CALLED ===
Payment reference received: { reference: 'BK-...' }
Step 1: Starting payment verification...
✅ Step 4: Payment verified successfully, submitting booking...
Step 5: Booking response received
✅ Step 7: Booking successful! Redirecting...
```

### Server Console Output

```
=== BOOKING API CALLED ===
Step 1: Validating environment configuration...
✅ Environment validation passed
Step 2: Parsing booking data...
✅ Payment reference found
Step 3: Re-verifying payment with Paystack...
✅ Payment re-verified successfully
Step 4: Generated booking ID
Step 5: Saving booking to database...
✅ Booking saved to database successfully
Step 6: Sending confirmation emails...
✅ Customer confirmation email sent successfully
✅ Admin notification email sent successfully
Step 7: Booking completed successfully
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Complete booking flow** and reach payment step
2. **Click "Confirm & Pay"**
3. **Use test card:**
   - Card: `4084084084084081`
   - CVV: `408`
   - PIN: `0000`
4. **Watch browser console** for:
   - `=== PAYMENT SUCCESS CALLBACK TRIGGERED ===`
   - `=== PAYMENT SUCCESS HANDLER CALLED ===`
5. **Check server console** for booking API logs
6. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Booking appears in Supabase database
   - ✅ Customer receives confirmation email
   - ✅ Admin receives notification email
   - ✅ User redirected to confirmation page

## Why This Works

### PaystackConsumer Architecture

The `PaystackConsumer` component works like this:

1. **Receives config** with all payment details + callbacks
2. **Passes config** to Paystack's JavaScript SDK
3. **Returns `initializePayment` function** that triggers the payment
4. **Paystack SDK calls callbacks** when payment completes/closes

### Key Insight

The callbacks must be **part of the initial config object**, not passed later to `initializePayment()`. This is how the Paystack SDK is designed to work.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Callbacks Still Don't Fire

1. **Check React re-renders:**
   - Callbacks are recreated on every render
   - May cause PaystackConsumer to lose reference

2. **Try useCallback:**
   ```typescript
   const onSuccessCallback = useCallback((reference: any) => {
     console.log('=== PAYMENT SUCCESS CALLBACK TRIGGERED ===');
     onPaymentSuccess(reference);
   }, [onPaymentSuccess]);
   ```

3. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - JavaScript errors can prevent callbacks from firing
   - Network errors can interrupt the payment flow

### If Payment Works But Booking Fails

1. **Check server logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are all set
3. **Check Supabase connection** and database schema
4. **Verify Resend API key** and domain verification

---

## Alternative Implementation (If Still Issues)

If the current approach still doesn't work, we can try the `usePaystackPayment` hook:

```typescript
import { usePaystackPayment } from 'react-paystack';

const config = {
  reference: paymentReference,
  email: state.email,
  amount: total * 100,
  publicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY || '',
  currency: 'ZAR',
};

const onSuccess = (reference: any) => {
  console.log('Payment successful', reference);
  onPaymentSuccess(reference);
};

const onClose = () => {
  console.log('Payment closed');
  onPaymentClose();
};

const initializePayment = usePaystackPayment(config);

// Then use:
<Button onClick={() => initializePayment(onSuccess, onClose)}>
  Pay Now
</Button>
```

---

## Status

**Version:** V2 (Final Solution)  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

This should resolve the callback issue completely. The callbacks are now properly integrated into the Paystack configuration object as expected by the react-paystack library.

**Test the booking flow now and look for the callback trigger logs!** 🚀
