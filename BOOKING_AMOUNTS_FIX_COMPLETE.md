# ✅ Booking Amounts Fix - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Summary

The admin dashboard was displaying incorrect booking amounts across both customer-created and admin-created bookings due to currency handling inconsistencies between the database storage (cents) and the display layer (rands).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Customer Bookings**: Showing very low amounts (R3.90, R3.50) with R0.00 service fees
2. **Admin Recurring Bookings**: Showing incorrect totals (R304.81 instead of R30,481)
3. **Currency Inconsistency**: Database stores in cents, but APIs were storing rands

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Customer Booking API (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**

**What was done**:
- Convert all amounts from rands (received from frontend) to cents before storing
- Lines 272-275: Updated `price_snapshot` to store amounts in cents
- Lines 291-295: Updated `cleaner_earnings` calculation to return cents
- Lines 334-338: Convert `total_amount`, `service_fee`, `frequency_discount` to cents

**Code**:
```typescript
const priceSnapshot = {
  // ...
  service_fee: (body.serviceFee || 0) * 100, // Convert to cents
  frequency_discount: (body.frequencyDiscount || 0) * 100, // Convert to cents
  subtotal: body.totalAmount ? (body.totalAmount - (body.serviceFee || 0) + (body.frequencyDiscount || 0)) * 100 : 0,
  total: (body.totalAmount || 0) * 100, // Convert to cents
  snapshot_date: new Date().toISOString(),
};

const cleanerEarnings = calculateCleanerEarnings(
  body.totalAmount ?? null,
  body.serviceFee ?? null,
  cleanerHireDate
) * 100; // Convert to cents

const { data, error: bookingError } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .insert({
    // ...
    total_amount: (body.totalAmount || 0) * 100, // Convert rands to cents
    cleaner_earnings: cleanerEarnings,
    service_fee: (body.serviceFee || 0) * 100, // Convert rands to cents
    frequency_discount: (body.frequencyDiscount || 0) * 100, // Convert rands to cents
    price_snapshot: priceSnapshot,
    // ...
  })
```

### 2. Admin One-Time Booking API (`app/api/admin/bookings/create/route.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**

**What was done**:
- Lines 92-100: Calculate pricing using `calcTotalAsync()` (returns rands)
- Lines 103-105: Convert pricing details from rands to cents
- Lines 108-110: Calculate cleaner earnings in cents
- Lines 113-126: Store price snapshot in cents
- Lines 143-147: Store booking amounts in cents

**Code**:
```typescript
// Calculate pricing for one-time booking
const pricingDetails = await calcTotalAsync(
  {
    service: data.service_type as ServiceType,
    bedrooms: data.bedrooms,
    bathrooms: data.bathrooms,
    extras: data.extras || [],
  },
  'one-time'
);

// Convert pricing details from rands to cents
const totalInCents = Math.round(pricingDetails.total * 100);
const serviceFeeInCents = Math.round(pricingDetails.serviceFee * 100);
const frequencyDiscountInCents = Math.round(pricingDetails.frequencyDiscount * 100);

// Calculate cleaner earnings (in cents)
const cleanerEarnings = cleanerIdForInsert 
  ? await calculateCleanerEarningsForCleaner(supabase, cleanerIdForInsert, pricingDetails.total, pricingDetails.serviceFee) * 100
  : 0;

const bookingData = {
  // ...
  total_amount: totalInCents,
  service_fee: serviceFeeInCents,
  frequency_discount: frequencyDiscountInCents,
  cleaner_earnings: cleanerEarnings,
  price_snapshot: priceSnapshot, // Already in cents
};
```

---

### 3. Admin Recurring Booking API (`app/api/admin/bookings/create/route.ts`)

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY FIXED**

**What was done**:
- Lines 250-264: Map custom frequencies and calculate pricing
- Line 267: **Explicitly set service fee to R0.00 for recurring bookings**
- Lines 268-269: Calculate total without service fee (in cents)
- Lines 272-274: Calculate cleaner earnings based on amount without service fee (in cents)
- Lines 276-290: Store price snapshot in cents
- Lines 292-314: Map bookings with amounts in cents

**Key Fix - Zero Service Fee for Recurring**:
```typescript
// Recurring bookings have NO service fee
const serviceFeeInCents = 0;
const totalWithoutServiceFee = Math.round((pricingDetails.subtotal - pricingDetails.frequencyDiscount) * 100);
const frequencyDiscountInCents = Math.round(pricingDetails.frequencyDiscount * 100);

// Calculate cleaner earnings (60% or 70% based on experience)
const cleanerEarnings = cleanerIdForInsert 
  ? await calculateCleanerEarningsForCleaner(supabase, cleanerIdForInsert, pricingDetails.subtotal - pricingDetails.frequencyDiscount, 0) * 100
  : 0;

const bookings = bookingDates.map(date => ({
  // ...
  total_amount: totalWithoutServiceFee,
  service_fee: serviceFeeInCents, // 0 for recurring
  frequency_discount: frequencyDiscountInCents,
  cleaner_earnings: cleanerEarnings,
}));
```

## 🎨 Display Components (No Changes Needed)

All display components were already correctly dividing amounts by 100 to convert from cents to rands:

### Admin Dashboard

**`components/admin/bookings-section.tsx`** (Lines 348-352):
```typescript
<div>R{(booking.total_amount / 100).toFixed(2)}</div>
<div className="text-xs text-gray-500">
  Fee: R{(booking.service_fee / 100).toFixed(2)} | 
  Cleaner: R{(booking.cleaner_earnings / 100).toFixed(2)}
</div>
```

**`components/admin/booking-details-dialog.tsx`** (Lines 196-228):
```typescript
<p className="font-semibold">R{(booking.total_amount / 100).toFixed(2)}</p>
<p className="font-semibold text-orange-600">R{(booking.service_fee / 100).toFixed(2)}</p>
<p className="font-semibold text-green-600">R{(booking.cleaner_earnings / 100).toFixed(2)}</p>
<p className="font-semibold text-blue-600">R{((booking.total_amount - booking.cleaner_earnings) / 100).toFixed(2)}</p>
```

### Customer Dashboard

**`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** (Line 470):
```typescript
<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary">R{(booking.total_amount / 100).toFixed(2)}</p>
```

### Cleaner Dashboard

**`components/cleaner/booking-card.tsx`** (Lines 95-97):
```typescript
const formatAmount = (earnings: number | null) => {
  if (!earnings) return 'TBD';
  return `R${(earnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`;  // Already dividing by 100
};
```

**`app/cleaner/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`** (Lines 180-184):
```typescript
const formatCurrency = (cents: number) => {
  if (cents === 0) {
    return 'R0.00';
  }
  return `R${(cents / 100).toFixed(2)}`;  // Already dividing by 100
};
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Customer-Created Bookings:
- **Before**: R3.90 total, R0.00 service fee (incorrect)
- **After**: R390.00 total, R40.00 service fee, R~230 cleaner earnings ✅

### Admin One-Time Bookings:
- **Before**: R3.04 total, R0.50 service fee (incorrect)
- **After**: R304.00 total, R50.00 service fee, R~180 cleaner earnings ✅

### Admin Recurring Bookings:
- **Before**: R304.81 total, R50.48 service fee (incorrect - should be R0)
- **After**: R304.00 total, R0.00 service fee, R~180 cleaner earnings ✅

---

## 🔍 Currency Handling Rules

### Database Storage:
- **All amounts in CENTS** (integers)
- `total_amount`, `service_fee`, `frequency_discount`, `cleaner_earnings`
- Example: R390.00 → stored as `39000`

### API Input/Output:
- **Frontend → API**: Sends amounts in RANDS (decimals)
- **API → Database**: Converts RANDS to CENTS (multiply by 100)
- **Database → API**: Amounts in CENTS
- **API → Frontend**: Amounts in CENTS (frontend divides by 100 for display)

### Display:
- **All components divide by 100** to convert cents → rands
- Format: `(amount / 100).toFixed(2)`
- Example: `39000 / 100 = R390.00`
