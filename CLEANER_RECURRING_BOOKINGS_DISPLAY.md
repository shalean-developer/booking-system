  - Frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
  - Day of week or day of month
  - Preferred time
  - Active status
  - Start and end dates

#### 2. Available Bookings API (`app/api/cleaner/bookings/available/route.ts`)
- Updated to include recurring schedule information for available jobs
- Shows cleaners which jobs are part of recurring schedules before claiming

### âœ… UI Components Updates

#### 2. My Bookings Component (`components/cleaner/my-bookings.tsx`)

- All bookings now display recurring indicators when applicable

#### 3. Available Bookings Component (`components/cleaner/available-bookings.tsx`)

```

### Modal Display
When cleaners open booking details, they see:

## Data Structure

### Recurring Schedule Object
```typescript
recurring_schedule?: {
  id: string;
  frequency: 'weekly' | 'bi-weekly' | 'monthly';
  day_of_week?: number;        // 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
  day_of_month?: number;        // 1-31
  preferred_time: string;       // HH:MM format
  is_active: boolean;
  start_date: string;           // YYYY-MM-DD
  end_date?: string;            // YYYY-MM-DD (optional)
} | null;
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

   - Look for bookings with blue recurring badge

2. **Check Available Jobs**:
   - Go to "Available Jobs" tab

## Database Requirements

### Migration Status
Ensure the recurring schedules migration has been applied:
- File: `supabase/migrations/create-recurring-schedules.sql`
- Creates: `recurring_schedules` table
- Adds: `recurring_schedule_id` column to `bookings` table

### To Apply Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run the migration SQL
3. Verify tables and columns exist

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/cleaner/bookings/route.ts`
2. `app/api/cleaner/bookings/available/route.ts`
3. `components/cleaner/my-bookings.tsx`
4. `components/cleaner/booking-card.tsx`
5. `components/cleaner/available-bookings.tsx`
6. `components/cleaner/booking-details-modal.tsx`

## TypeScript Type Safety

All components now have proper TypeScript interfaces for recurring schedule data:
- Type-safe recurring schedule object
- Optional fields properly typed
- Frequency as union type: `'weekly' | 'bi-weekly' | 'monthly'`

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Improvements
1. **Recurring Pattern Calendar**
   - Show calendar view of recurring bookings
   - Visualize upcoming occurrences

2. **Recurring Job Filters**

3. **Earnings Projections**
   - Calculate projected earnings from recurring bookings

5. **Smart Notifications**

   - Alert about upcoming recurring bookings

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
