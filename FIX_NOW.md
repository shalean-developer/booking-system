You're getting this error:
```
Failed to claim booking. It may have been claimed by another cleaner.
```

## Quick Fix (Takes 2 Minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Apply SQL Fix in Supabase

**Open:** [Your Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) ‚Üí **SQL Editor** ‚Üí **New Query**

**Copy & Paste this:**
```sql
-- Drop old policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cleaners can claim bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cleaners can view available bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cleaners can view assigned bookings" ON bookings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cleaners can update assigned bookings" ON bookings;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Cleaners can claim available bookings" ON bookings
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (cleaner_id IS NULL AND status = 'pending')
  WITH CHECK (cleaner_id IS NOT NULL AND status = 'pending');

CREATE POLICY "Cleaners can view available bookings" ON bookings
  FOR SELECT
  USING (cleaner_id IS NULL AND status = 'pending');

CREATE POLICY "Cleaners can view assigned bookings" ON bookings
  FOR SELECT
  USING (cleaner_id IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Cleaners can update assigned bookings" ON bookings
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (cleaner_id IS NOT NULL)
  WITH CHECK (cleaner_id IS NOT NULL);
```

**Click:** RUN (or press Ctrl+Enter)

‚úÖ You should see: "Success completed"

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Restart Dev Server

In your terminal:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then start again:
npm run dev
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Try Again with Better Logging

Now when you try to claim a booking, your **terminal** will show detailed logs like:

```
üìû Claim booking API called
‚úÖ Cleaner authenticated: John Doe abc123
üéØ Booking ID: booking-xyz
üîå Supabase client created
üìã Booking found: { id: 'xyz', status: 'pending', cleaner_id: null }
üîÑ Attempting to claim booking...
‚úÖ Booking claimed: xyz by John Doe
```

**If you still see an error**, the terminal will show **exactly** what's wrong!

## Still Having Issues?

### Check #1: Is SQL Fix Applied?
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor: `CHECK_CLEANER_FIX_STATUS.sql`

Look for: ‚úÖ PASS (not ‚ùå MISSING)

### Check #2: Look at Terminal Logs
After clicking "Claim Job", your terminal will show:
- ‚ùå **Database error claiming booking:** - Shows the real problem!
- **code: '42501'** or **"policy"** in message ‚Üí SQL fix not applied
- Any other error ‚Üí See the details in the log

### Check #3: Are There Available Bookings?
Make sure bookings exist:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí bookings
2. Look for rows where `cleaner_id` is NULL and `status` is 'pending'
3. If none exist, create a test booking first

## Quick Test

After applying the fix:
1. Login as cleaner: `http://localhost:3000/cleaner/login`
2. Go to "Available Jobs" tab
3. Click "Claim Job"
4. Watch your **terminal** for detailed logs
5. Should see: ‚úÖ "Booking claimed successfully!"

## Files to Use:

1. **CLEANER_CLAIM_JOB_QUICK_FIX.sql** ‚Üê Use this in Supabase!
2. **CHECK_CLEANER_FIX_STATUS.sql** ‚Üê Verify it worked
3. **TROUBLESHOOTING_CLAIM_JOB.md** ‚Üê Detailed debugging guide

---

**TL;DR**: Copy `CLEANER_CLAIM_JOB_QUICK_FIX.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor, click Run, restart `npm run dev`, try again. Your terminal will now show what's happening! üéØ
